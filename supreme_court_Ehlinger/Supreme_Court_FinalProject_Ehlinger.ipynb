Cendant 5 Mortgage Corporation. 6 Mr. Rosenkranz. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 There is only one natural way to read the 12 language at issue here. A \"court of competent 13 jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source 14 of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court 15 has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start 16 with the plain language. 17 The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The 18 power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 19 \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\" 20 The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to 21 say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any 22 State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, 23 State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent 24 jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a 25 court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n4 1 examine the statutes creating that court and granting it 2 jurisdiction. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -4 you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is 5 this court competent to hear this controversy\" would 6 include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you 7 limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction? 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it 9 to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. 10 It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a 11 court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has 12 subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has 13 personal jurisdiction. 14 And the -- the cases that my friends rely 15 upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are 16 cases in which there was already subject-matter 17 jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a 18 minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter 19 jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those 20 cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction. 21 Now, five times this Court has interpreted 22 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote, 23 \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional 24 authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone; 25 this Court held that any reference to competent\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n3 unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n4 should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n5 respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n6 And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n7 map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n8 Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n9 require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n10 jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n11 which word modifies it.\\n\\n12 So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n13 to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n14 read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n15 State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n16 a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n18 does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n19 argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n20 of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n21 court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n22 capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n23 jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n24 That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n25 Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n6 1 Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction. 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice 3 Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is 4 to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that 5 Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I 6 quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued 7 provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if, 8 but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal 9 courts.\" 10 So you need a mention of Federal courts in 11 order to even have a conversation about whether the 12 \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is 13 not sufficient. 14 And so another way to think about it is, 15 sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court, 16 State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without 17 more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find 19 this pretty tough. I think that there are five major 20 cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux 21 is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent 22 jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the 23 Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here. 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n7 1 JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way. 2 And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it 3 comes out the other way. And so what I see going for 4 you is one page of legislative history which says, 5 explicitly, you\\'re right. 6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that 8 legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it? 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the 10 legislative history. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more 13 going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of 14 the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over 15 again, three times before this provision -- those words 16 were added to this provision. This Court interpreted 17 that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting 18 and said, it must point to an outside source of 19 authority. And our -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But 21 these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly 22 in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this 23 issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\" 24 And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X, 25 did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n8 1 means -- because it refers probably to specific courts 2 and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in 3 general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction. 4 It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued. 5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree 6 respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized 7 these cases. 8 So Osborn, if you wanted to write a 9 provision that parses the legislative language the way 10 Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It 11 says, sue and be sued in all State courts having 12 competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit 13 court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish 14 State courts. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is 18 the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical. 19 And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is 20 the word \"State and Federal\" -21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench, 22 Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or 23 Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t 25 figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n9\\n\\n2 situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n3 because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n4 And then when you --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n6 difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n7 from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n8 the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n9 authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n10 competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n11 How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n12 generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n13 courts?\\n\\n14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n15 answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n16 The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n17 that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n18 jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n19 is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n20 courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n22 presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n23 context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n24 personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n10\\n\\n2 jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n3 subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n4 question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n5 jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n6 harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n7 confines of the Court.\\n\\n8 But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n9 again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n10 statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n11 clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n12 State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n13 to every Federal court either.\\n\\n14 The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n15 The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n16 jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n17 are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n18 And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n19 take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n20 reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n21 modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n22 same word.\\n\\n23 And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n24 this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n25 Step 1 was the original enactment. It was\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n11 1 before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per 2 Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not 3 grant jurisdiction. 4 Step 2 was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been 5 decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite 6 of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember, 7 there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and 8 then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to 9 match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision 10 that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took 11 a right turn and added the words \"competent 12 jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for 13 example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on 14 other provisions of law.\" 15 Step 3 was 1974. After the shift to private 16 entity was consummated, Congress further amended the 17 charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity 18 jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal 19 jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no 20 longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction 21 in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose 22 for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed 23 Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of 24 Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of 25 jurisdiction and venue.\"\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n12 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to 2 keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else. 3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For 4 purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It 5 could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but 6 look to the venue provisions to figure out where the 7 suit is appropriately brought. 8 This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 9 Every court that has ever evaluated this language has 10 concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 11 Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the 12 only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen 13 times since this case was first briefed, and just last 14 Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that 15 this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t 16 need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued 17 clause that grants Federal jurisdiction. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a 19 belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can 20 rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession 21 that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction. 22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your 23 Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie. 24 So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and 25 Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n3 not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n4 Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n5 public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n6 Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n7 diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n8 Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n12 bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n13 not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n14 would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n15 and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n16 history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n17 it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n18 Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n19 the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n20 otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n21 But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n22 back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n23 something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n24 sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n25 because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n14 1 stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And 2 then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there 3 is add some old report that sort of seemed to support 4 the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of 5 legislative history here. 6 But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we 7 shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard 8 enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and 9 Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going? 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to 12 look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re 13 going to end up with a result that seems to be different 14 than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It 15 was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the 16 page of legislative history. It will be better for the 17 lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will 18 be simpler for them. 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that 21 I\\'m in. 22 Anything anybody wants to say to help me 23 would be welcome. 24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let 25 me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 white light is on.\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n3 need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n4 conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n5 got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n6 But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n7 find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n8 competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n9 is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n10 words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n11 other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n12 And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n13 concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n14 private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n15 I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n16 involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n17 State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n18 there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n19 cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n20 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n22 Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n24 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n25 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n16 1 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 2 it please the Court: 3 The government\\'s view is that the rule of 4 Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that 5 authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or 6 be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" 7 The best reading of that phrase in Fannie 8 Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to 9 sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is 10 vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of 11 law. 12 We think there is a plausible story for why 13 Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued 14 clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if 15 you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying, 16 the text of the statute should control. 17 The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell 18 Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity 19 may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State 20 or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that 21 Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the 22 Federal courts. 23 In this case, the Court should give Congress 24 the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language 25 \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n17 1 competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have 2 to look to some other provision of law to see if that 3 court is vested with jurisdiction. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -5 my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been 6 able to identify, eight other statutes that use the 7 \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language. 8 Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number 9 of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B, 10 are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes 11 may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie 12 Mae is? 13 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those 14 statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the 15 sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that 16 says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving 17 this entity. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one. 19 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you 21 mean. 22 MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by 23 this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of 24 the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the 25 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n18\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n3 would be --\\n\\n4 MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n5 have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n6 also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n7 But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n8 that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n9 Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n10 all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n11 or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n12 brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n13 can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n14 a party.\\n\\n15 I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n16 to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n17 cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n18 cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n19 There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n20 frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n21 State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n22 HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n23 leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n24 courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n25 the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 as in this case.\\n\\n19\\n\\n2 If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n3 which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n4 sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n5 jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n6 over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n7 the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n8 resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n9 borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n10 HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n11 clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n12 to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n13 over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n15 statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n16 Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n17 two --\\n\\n18 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n19 corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n21 the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n22 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n23 Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n24 clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n25 create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n20 1 there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross 2 about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued 3 clause. 4 I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely 5 advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as 6 in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter 7 jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued 8 clause, that you have to -9 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used 10 the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent 11 jurisdiction,\" was Osborn. 12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -13 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that? 14 MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think 15 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says, 16 \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any 17 circuit court of the United States.\" 18 So I think in that case what the Court said 19 was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on 20 all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use 21 the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it 22 referred to the Federal courts. It used that language 23 only with respect to the State courts. 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language 25 \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n21 1 It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case 2 was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as 3 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter 4 used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked 5 exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in 6 D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in 7 1954, Congress changed it to mean something different. 8 One of the main rationales of the court of 9 appeals in this case was that the -- the work that 10 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s 11 telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized 12 court, like a State traffic court or a Federal 13 bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase 14 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do 15 that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes 16 authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the 17 suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that 18 particular court. We are just asking for the same 19 analysis to be done with Federal district courts. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the 21 judgments that have been entered, reading this the way 22 the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split 23 jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? 24 What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t 25 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n22 1 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the 3 way you want us to read them. 4 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases 5 are already finished that res judicata would -- you 6 know, their -- those cases would still stand on their 7 own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to 8 say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases 9 could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or 10 removed to Federal court. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have 12 res judicata if you never had subject-matter 13 jurisdiction? 14 MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking 15 about a case where -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up 17 subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but 18 you can\\'t when you -19 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up 21 to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it 22 collaterally. 23 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if 24 these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are 25 still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n23 1 subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases 2 are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the 3 case and bring that up. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the 5 ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as 6 wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a 7 final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct 8 review, then you can\\'t collaterally review. 9 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice 10 Ginsburg. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of 13 competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look 14 at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you 15 could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for 16 the same rule in the Federal district courts. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language 18 that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or 19 Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and 20 they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you 21 want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say 22 \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in 23 State court; we want them to be in State court. 24 Have you found any that say just something 25 like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n24\\n\\n2 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n3 in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n4 Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n6 once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n7 jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n8 out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n9 getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n10 to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n11 the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n13 of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n14 JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n15 MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n16 phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n17 you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n18 court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n19 competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n20 The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n21 statutes --\\n\\n22 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n23 MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n24 asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n25 district courts.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n25 1 The Respondents refer to the Federal 2 district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but 3 just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal 4 district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You 5 cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a 6 Federal district court unless there is complete 7 diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in 8 controversy. 9 So that language, \"court of competent 10 jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the 11 statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether 12 this suit is authorized to be brought there. 13 There\\'s a few other textual points that I 14 think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is 15 that Section 1349 should be an important point of 16 reference. Congress established a general rule that 17 having a government charter is not enough to confer 18 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United 19 States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and 20 when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie 21 Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication 22 from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter 23 jurisdiction. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 25 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n26 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks. 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS 3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 4 MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 5 and may it please the Court: 6 The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong 7 and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench, 8 Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for 9 Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal 10 policy through the corporate form. 11 Now, when Congress expressly provides that a 12 federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue 13 and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction 14 under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and 15 their prodigy. 16 Congress can obviously displace that rule if 17 it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do 18 that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\" 19 as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that 20 rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding 21 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as 22 a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise 23 existed, particularly given the history of what was 24 going on. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n27 1 jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have 2 competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for 3 subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction? 4 That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means. 5 MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor, 6 what competent jurisdiction means here has to be 7 understood in light of the whole phrase. And 8 Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is 9 all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent 10 jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase. 11 The whole phrase is, \"competent 12 jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had 13 been interpreted three times in three different 14 appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing 15 agency in the same statute, and that is the language 16 that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of 17 those appellate decisions at that time, every one of 18 them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent 19 jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction. 20 I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans 21 case, and the Seven Oaks case. 22 Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that 23 the language it was borrowing from another agency in the 24 same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would 25 restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n3 the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n4 MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n6 different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n7 act.\\n\\n8 MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n9 make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n10 historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n11 Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n12 Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n13 statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n14 reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n15 time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n16 Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n17 was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n18 would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n19 here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n20 the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n21 language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n22 \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n23 been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n24 jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n2 jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n3 about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n4 interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n5 phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n6 Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n7 at the two phrases together.\\n\\n8 And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n9 \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n10 jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n11 jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n12 Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n14 position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n15 you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n16 you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n17 competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n18 don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n19 you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n20 jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n21 they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n22 MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n23 the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n24 \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n25 mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n30 1 So the three things we think competent 2 jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of 3 the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was 4 these three things. 5 So the first thing was, there was a very 6 vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature 7 of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they 8 were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard 9 in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard 10 generally in the district courts. This was the precise 11 question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add, 12 that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in 13 briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under 14 these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in 15 the Portsmouth case. Okay? 16 But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this 17 context was held to mean at that time was the direction 18 that general jurisdiction courts, and not only 19 specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case. 20 The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the 21 time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase, 22 later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State 23 court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of 24 Claims. And that issue was resolved. 25 The second thing --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n31 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said 2 \"general jurisdiction,\" right? 3 MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\" 5 instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when 6 \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the 7 sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to 8 sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed 9 to the Court. 10 Does this Court have authority to proceed in 11 this category of cases? 12 MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we 13 think all these things work together is, first of all, 14 as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent 15 jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously 16 held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right? 17 Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no 18 cases to the contrary at the time. 19 And the understanding of what \"competent 20 jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all, 21 from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s 22 fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because 23 the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of 24 Federal housing policy having very little to do with 25 jurisdiction.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n32 1 And we think what happened is they simply 2 borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to 3 confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae. 4 There was no other reason to think they meant anything 5 different from that. 6 But we also know that less than two years 7 before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this 8 Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a 9 standalone basis and said that all it referred to at 10 that time in that context was personal jurisdiction. 11 That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent 12 jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means 13 is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it 14 means personal jurisdiction courts of general 15 jurisdiction. 16 Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the 17 question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued 18 clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor, 19 that your clerk has. We have nine total, including 20 Fannie Mae. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three 22 versions, but that\\'s okay. 23 (Laughter.) 24 MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine. 25 (Laughter.)\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n33 1 MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know. 2 The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent 3 jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very 4 early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent 5 jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists 6 only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a 7 generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we 8 urge on this Court today. 9 The rule is, when combined with the grant of 10 jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red 11 Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general 12 jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the 13 grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and 14 its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional 15 rule that is very clean. 16 Now -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry. 18 MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going 19 to -- go ahead. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the 21 other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases 22 that are going to be added to the Federal docket. 23 Do you have an answer to that? 24 MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that, 25 Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n3 working hard enough.\\n\\n4 (Laughter.)\\n\\n5 MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n6 that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n7 Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n10 (Laughter.)\\n\\n11 MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n12 to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n13 Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n14 charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n15 belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n16 almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n17 has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n19 statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n20 Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n21 to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n22 didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n23 said --\\n\\n24 MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n25 couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n35 1 Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the 2 Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s 3 no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for 4 Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie 5 Mae, its sister organization. 6 Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about 7 Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know 8 is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative 9 history in both the House Report and the Senate Report 10 make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to 11 create an entity that had identical powers that would 12 develop in parallel and that would have no advantage 13 over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in 14 drafting it. 15 Now, the words were unquestionably 16 different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter 17 were different from the words in the Second Bank of the 18 United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. 19 The reason the words were different at the 20 time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of 21 writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without 22 60 years of history, without the need to extricate a 23 legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization 24 scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit 25 down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 like.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n36\\n\\n2 JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n3 talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n4 legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n5 says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n6 are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n7 we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n8 right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n9 may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n10 intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n11 know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n12 State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n13 I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n14 jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n15 natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n16 but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n17 the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n18 them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n19 if you want?\\n\\n20 MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n22 what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n23 look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n24 that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n25 MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 points.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n37\\n\\n2 So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n3 reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n4 \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n5 from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n6 State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n7 that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n8 jurisdiction.\\n\\n9 But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n10 you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n11 is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n12 And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n13 statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n14 clearer.\\n\\n15 But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n16 counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n17 created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n18 probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n19 an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n20 In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n21 authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n22 mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n23 sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n24 that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n25 to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n38 1 legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and 2 Chicago, and New York, and would start creating 3 liquidity to solve the problem. 4 So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That 5 was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley, 6 the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost 7 his re-election campaign. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume, 11 or perhaps hope. 12 But in any case, 1938 was a different 13 statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that 14 wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter 15 for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created 16 in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was 17 adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the 18 language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme 19 language. 20 So somebody has to prevail, either the 21 Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the 22 failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is 23 most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red 24 Cross. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n39 1 courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts 2 of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have 3 to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish 4 their right to be there. 5 Now, I think you have to do more than win 6 51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction. 7 Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more 8 than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration 9 that we need to take into account. 10 MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, 11 there\\'s no question that the courts are limited 12 jurisdiction courts, and we should look at 13 subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye. 14 Having said that, this fundamentally is a 15 case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did 16 Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s 17 about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but 18 that under Article III -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways 20 that you could -- if you want to make sure that this 21 entity gets into Federal court all the time, what 22 Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will 23 be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and 24 removal purposes. 25 Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n40 1 come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove 2 if it\\'s sued in State court. 3 This, compared to \"court of competent 4 jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent 5 jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the 6 Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and 7 personal. 8 MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin 9 where you ended, if I might, and just say that this 10 Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase 11 \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay, 12 has multiple different meanings depending on context. 13 In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this 14 Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter 15 jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal 16 jurisdiction citing cases. 17 In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. 18 Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before 19 our statute was decided, it said that in that context, 20 the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. 21 So I think the only way to harmonize all of 22 these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction 23 is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross 24 language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the 25 other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n2 jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n3 holds.\\n\\n4 But the most --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n6 Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n7 subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n8 personal.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n10 And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n11 intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n12 understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n13 had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n14 for 20 years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n15 verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n16 language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n17 subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n18 Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n19 years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n20 those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n21 any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n22 on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n23 Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n24 briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n25 the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n3 was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n4 company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n5 courts.\\n\\n6 The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n7 that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n8 owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n9 from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n10 there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n11 sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n12 Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n13 shareholders.\\n\\n14 Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n15 that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n16 its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n17 Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n18 course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n19 writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n20 that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n21 question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n22 pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n23 qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n24 But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n25 it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n43 1 in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not 2 privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even 3 when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954 4 Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it 5 still had special access to the Federal courts under 6 1345. 7 So if there had been a conscious legislative 8 judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at 9 that time, they surely would have had to do the work of 10 taking away its agency status. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to 12 the Federal court. They can be there if there is 13 diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law. 14 MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That 15 exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised 16 specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion 17 in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that 18 Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds. 19 And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not 20 being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove 21 on lots of grounds all the time. 22 And by the way -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have 24 the competence language. It was just any court, State 25 or Federal.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n44 1 MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I 2 was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction 3 didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources, 4 and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful 5 evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter. 6 Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and 7 suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued 8 in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -9 Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction. 10 But what else Freddie says is Freddie says 11 that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345 12 purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have 13 statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the 14 limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct 15 grounds for getting to Federal court. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do 17 that for Fannie Mae? 18 MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard 19 to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of 20 the Framers of our charter. But the original charter 21 language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was 22 written at a time when we were connected with multiple 23 other agencies. We were part of the Department of 24 Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became 25 Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n45 1 essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this 2 big accretion of language over decades. 3 Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So 4 Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting 5 from scratch. 6 I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s 7 colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would 8 happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute. 9 And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor 10 Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen. 11 We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We 12 want to add this competent jurisdiction language. 13 Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times 14 before, and all of those cases said that confers 15 jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or 16 perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a 17 way of removing jurisdiction. 18 That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in 19 this case than it did in the prior case to me, given 20 what the case law backdrop was of the time. 21 Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point 22 about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you 23 know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac 24 has different language. The question is, is this a good 25 thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n46 1 Our view basically is Congress said what it 2 meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said 3 that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were 4 supposed to have no advantages over each other and have 5 all the same powers. 6 The question for this Court is: Why would 7 Congress -- although it used a different language across 8 multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac 9 to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same 10 securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC 11 exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit, 12 but have different Federal court litigating powers? 13 There\\'s no answer to that. 14 And all we know is that in terms of the 15 Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what 16 we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only 17 much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to 18 imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest 19 company in the United States by assets, creating housing 20 across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been 21 intended not to be protected by Federal court 22 jurisdiction. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I 24 mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this 25 language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n47 1 It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there 2 is a human being who wrote it. 3 MR. BROOKS: Yeah. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come 5 from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know? 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired. 8 MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former 9 staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope 10 not. 11 Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We 12 know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t 13 created in nineteen -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words, 15 \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent 16 jurisdiction\" -17 MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\" 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\" 19 You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who 20 did this. 21 MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you 22 know. 23 Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know 24 the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was 25 written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n48 1 Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the 2 phrase first came from. And we know that that language 3 had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress 4 had no indication it could have meant anything else. We 5 know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the 6 Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase, 7 \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred 8 jurisdiction. 9 Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in 10 briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this 11 exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing 12 Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition 13 to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth 14 Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson, 15 the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates 16 jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what 17 we know. That has always been the understanding. 18 And if we didn\\'t have that history and we 19 didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently 20 on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn 21 and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we 22 know what it means. 23 The disruption that would be created in the 24 markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower 25 courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n2 appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n3 powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n5 reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n6 there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n7 is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n8 Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n9 Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n10 MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n11 unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n12 President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n13 2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n14 access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n15 registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n16 no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n17 and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n18 intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n19 I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n20 statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n21 imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n22 the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n23 Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n24 \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n25 they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n50 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they 2 have that different structure on the board of directors? 3 MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and 4 it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to 5 some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late 6 \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials, 7 because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its 8 Federal agency role. 9 Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. 10 Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 11 1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie 12 Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be 13 torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original 14 board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of 15 Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD 16 Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general 17 counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that 18 time, and it took multiple years before they could be 19 extricated. There is just a history here, which makes 20 it different. 21 But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the 22 largest participant in the largest market in the U.S. 23 economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers 24 and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because 25 the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n2 would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n3 isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n4 If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n5 you.\\n\\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n7 Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E.

ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n11 Just a couple of points.\\n\\n12 First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n13 do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n14 seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n15 cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n16 This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n17 language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n18 was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n19 right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n20 was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n21 Court addressed it?\\n\\n22 Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n23 simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n24 that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n25 Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n52 1 reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around 2 this proposition that it might actually mean other 3 things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it 4 means. 5 Fannie says it could mean personal 6 jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It 7 could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those 8 words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But 9 the bottom line is you need to commit to what that 10 meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by 11 interpreting those words to mean what this Court has 12 said of competent jurisdiction. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means 14 personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute 16 says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has 17 personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or 18 Federal. 19 Well, the Federal Court of Claims has 20 personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a 21 grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is 22 that this now turns into a grant of Federal 23 subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of 24 jurisdiction to Fannie. 25 So what about the court of appeals cases\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n2 interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n3 they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n4 understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n5 there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n6 whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n7 court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n8 court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n10 position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n12 explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n13 the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n14 drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n15 did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n16 Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n17 If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n18 Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n19 differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n20 apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n21 supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n22 what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n23 were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n24 Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n25 So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n3 one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n4 held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n5 of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n6 jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n7 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n9 The case is submitted.\\n\\n10 (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the\\n\\n11 above-entitled matter was submitted.)\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial -

ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 There is only one natural way to read the 12 language at issue here. A \"court of competent 13 jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source 14 of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court 15 has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start 16 with the plain language. 17 The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The 18 power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 19 \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\" 20 The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to 21 say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any 22 State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, 23 State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent 24 jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a 25 court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to',\n",

ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it 9 to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. 10 It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a 11 court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has 12 subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has 13 personal jurisdiction. 14 And the -- the cases that my friends rely 15 upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are 16 cases in which there was already subject-matter 17 jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a 18 minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter 19 jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those 20 cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction. 21 Now, five times this Court has interpreted 22 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote, 23 \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional 24 authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix.

       " '6 1 Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction. 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice 3 Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is 4 to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that 5 Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I 6 quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued 7 provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if, 8 but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal 9 courts.\" 10 So you need a mention of Federal courts in 11 order to even have a conversation about whether the 12 \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is 13 not sufficient. 14 And so another way to think about it is, 15 sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court, 16 State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without 17 more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find 19 this pretty tough. I think that there are five major 20 cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux 21 is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent 22 jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the 23 Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here. 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --',\n",

ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that 8 legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it? 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the 10 legislative history. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more 13 going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of 14 the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over 15 again, three times before this provision -- those words 16 were added to this provision. This Court interpreted 17 that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting 18 and said, it must point to an outside source of 19 authority. And our -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But 21 these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly 22 in point.

So now D\\'Oench has been 5 decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite 6 of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember, 7 there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and 8 then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to 9 match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision 10 that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took 11 a right turn and added the words \"competent 12 jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for 13 example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on 14 other provisions of law.\" 15 Step 3 was 1974. After the shift to private 16 entity was consummated, Congress further amended the 17 charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity 18 jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal 19 jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no 20 longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction 21 in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose 22 for diversity jurisdiction.

There are a lot of ways Congress can do 18 that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\" 19 as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that 20 rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency.

This was the precise 11 question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add, 12 that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in 13 briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under 14 these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in 15 the Portsmouth case. Okay? 16 But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this 17 context was held to mean at that time was the direction 18 that general jurisdiction courts, and not only 19 specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case. 20 The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the 21 time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase, 22 later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State 23 court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of 24 Claims.

BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we 13 think all these things work together is, first of all, 14 as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent 15 jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously 16 held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right? 17 Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no 18 cases to the contrary at the time. 19 And the understanding of what \"competent 20 jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all, 21 from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s 22 fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because 23 the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of 24 Federal housing policy having very little to do with 25 jurisdiction.',\n",

But what we think it means 13 is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it 14 means personal jurisdiction courts of general 15 jurisdiction. 16 Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the 17 question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued 18 clauses like ours.

So the first thing we know 8 is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative 9 history in both the House Report and the Senate Report 10 make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to 11 create an entity that had identical powers that would 12 develop in parallel and that would have no advantage 13 over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in 14 drafting it. 15 Now, the words were unquestionably 16 different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter 17 were different from the words in the Second Bank of the 18 United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. 19 The reason the words were different at the 20 time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of 21 writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without 22 60 years of history, without the need to extricate a 23 legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization 24 scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit 25 down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\",\n",

       " ' ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case No. 14-1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant 5 Mortgage Corporation. 6 Mr. Rosenkranz. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 There is only one natural way to read the 12 language at issue here. A \"court of competent 13 jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source 14 of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court 15 has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start 16 with the plain language. 17 The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The 18 power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 19 \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\" 20 The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to 21 say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any 22 State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, 23 State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent 24 jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a 25 court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n4 1 examine the statutes creating that court and granting it 2 jurisdiction. 3 ',\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: Does that include -4 you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is 5 this court competent to hear this controversy\" would 6 include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you 7 limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction? 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it 9 to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. 10 It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a 11 court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has 12 subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has 13 personal jurisdiction. 14 And the -- the cases that my friends rely 15 upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are 16 cases in which there was already subject-matter 17 jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a 18 minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter 19 jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those 20 cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction. 21 Now, five times this Court has interpreted 22 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote, 23 \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional 24 authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone; 25 this Court held that any reference to competent\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n3 unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n4 should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n5 respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n6 And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n7 map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n8 Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n9 require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n10 jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n11 which word modifies it.\\n\\n12 So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n13 to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n14 read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n15 State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n16 a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n17 ',\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n18 does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n19 argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n20 of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n21 court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n22 capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n23 jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n24 That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n25 Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n6 1 Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction. 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice 3 Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is 4 to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that 5 Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I 6 quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued 7 provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if, 8 but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal 9 courts.\" 10 So you need a mention of Federal courts in 11 order to even have a conversation about whether the 12 \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is 13 not sufficient. 14 And so another way to think about it is, 15 sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court, 16 State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without 17 more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction. 18 ',\n",
       " ' BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find 19 this pretty tough. I think that there are five major 20 cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux 21 is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent 22 jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the 23 Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here. 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n7 1 ',\n",
       " \" BREYER: It comes out the other way. 2 And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it 3 comes out the other way. And so what I see going for 4 you is one page of legislative history which says, 5 explicitly, you're right. 6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. 7 \",\n",
       " \" BREYER: Do you want to deny that 8 legislative history? It helps you, doesn't it? 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the 10 legislative history. 11 \",\n",
       " ' BREYER: Right. 12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more 13 going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of 14 the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over 15 again, three times before this provision -- those words 16 were added to this provision. This Court interpreted 17 that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting 18 and said, it must point to an outside source of 19 authority. And our -20 ',\n",
       " ' BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But 21 these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly 22 in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this 23 issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\" 24 And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X, 25 did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n8 1 means -- because it refers probably to specific courts 2 and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in 3 general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction. 4 It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued. 5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree 6 respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized 7 these cases. 8 So Osborn, if you wanted to write a 9 provision that parses the legislative language the way 10 Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It 11 says, sue and be sued in all State courts having 12 competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit 13 court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish 14 State courts. 15 ',\n",
       " ' BREYER: I got that one. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. 17 ',\n",
       " ' BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is 18 the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical. 19 And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is 20 the word \"State and Federal\" -21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench, 22 Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or 23 Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t 25 figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n9\\n\\n2 situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n3 because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n4 And then when you --\\n\\n5 ',\n",
       " \" SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n6 difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n7 from a provision creating a cause of action? Let's do\\n\\n8 the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n9 authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n10 competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n11 How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n12 generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n13 courts?\\n\\n14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n15 answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n16 The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n17 that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n18 jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n19 is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n20 courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n21 \",\n",
       " ' SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n22 presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n23 context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n24 personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n10\\n\\n2 jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n3 subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n4 question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n5 jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n6 harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n7 confines of the Court.\\n\\n8 But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n9 again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n10 statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n11 clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n12 State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n13 to every Federal court either.\\n\\n14 The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n15 The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n16 jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n17 are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n18 And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n19 take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n20 reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n21 modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n22 same word.\\n\\n23 And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n24 this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n25 Step 1 was the original enactment. It was\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n11 1 before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per 2 Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not 3 grant jurisdiction. 4 Step 2 was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been 5 decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite 6 of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember, 7 there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and 8 then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to 9 match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision 10 that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took 11 a right turn and added the words \"competent 12 jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for 13 example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on 14 other provisions of law.\" 15 Step 3 was 1974. After the shift to private 16 entity was consummated, Congress further amended the 17 charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity 18 jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal 19 jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no 20 longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction 21 in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose 22 for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed 23 Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of 24 Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of 25 jurisdiction and venue.\"\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n12 1 ',\n",
       " ' SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to 2 keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else. 3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For 4 purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It 5 could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but 6 look to the venue provisions to figure out where the 7 suit is appropriately brought. 8 This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 9 Every court that has ever evaluated this language has 10 concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 11 Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the 12 only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen 13 times since this case was first briefed, and just last 14 Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that 15 this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t 16 need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued 17 clause that grants Federal jurisdiction. 18 CHIEF ',\n",
       " \" ROBERTS: Well, that's just a 19 belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can 20 rely on diversity jurisdiction. It's not a concession 21 that they don't have general Federal jurisdiction. 22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your 23 Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie. 24 So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and 25 Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 it's -- it's the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n3 not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n4 Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n5 public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n6 Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n7 diversity provision to Ginnie's charter, only to\\n\\n8 Fannie's charter. And I do think --\\n\\n9 \",\n",
       " ' BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n11 ',\n",
       " \" BREYER: This is what's really\\n\\n12 bothering me here, and I don't know if you can help or\\n\\n13 not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n14 would think you're right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n15 and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n16 history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n17 it to the senators, and they thought, we don't want\\n\\n18 Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n19 the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n20 otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n21 But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n22 back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n23 something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n24 sense, but it's even there in D'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n25 because it's -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n14 1 stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And 2 then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there 3 is add some old report that sort of seemed to support 4 the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of 5 legislative history here. 6 But I see now it's jurisdiction. And we 7 shouldn't get things too mixed up. They are hard 8 enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and 9 Federal, you -- you see where I'm going? 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 11 \",\n",
       " \" BREYER: So I don't know whether to 12 look into it deeply in this particular case where you're 13 going to end up with a result that seems to be different 14 than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It 15 was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the 16 page of legislative history. It will be better for the 17 lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will 18 be simpler for them. 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 20 \",\n",

You\\n\\n3 need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n4 conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n5 got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n6 But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n7 find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n8 competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n9 is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n10 words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n11 other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n12 And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n13 concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n14 private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n15 I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n16 involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n17 State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n18 there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n19 cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n20 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n21 CHIEF ',\n",

O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 2 it please the Court: 3 The government\\'s view is that the rule of 4 Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that 5 authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or 6 be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" 7 The best reading of that phrase in Fannie 8 Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to 9 sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is 10 vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of 11 law. 12 We think there is a plausible story for why 13 Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued 14 clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if 15 you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying, 16 the text of the statute should control. 17 The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell 18 Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity 19 may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State 20 or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that 21 Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the 22 Federal courts. 23 In this case, the Court should give Congress 24 the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language 25 \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n17 1 competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have 2 to look to some other provision of law to see if that 3 court is vested with jurisdiction. 4 ',\n",

It didn\\'t use 21 the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it 22 referred to the Federal courts.

One is 15 that Section 1349 should be an important point of 16 reference. Congress established a general rule that 17 having a government charter is not enough to confer 18 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United 19 States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and 20 when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie 21 Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication 22 from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter 23 jurisdiction. 24 CHIEF ',\n",

BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 5 and may it please the Court: 6 The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong 7 and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench, 8 Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for 9 Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal 10 policy through the corporate form. 11 Now, when Congress expressly provides that a 12 federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue 13 and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction 14 under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and 15 their prodigy. 16 Congress can obviously displace that rule if 17 it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do 18 that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\" 19 as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that 20 rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding 21 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as 22 a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise 23 existed, particularly given the history of what was 24 going on. 25 ',\n",

So -- so, Your Honor, 6 what competent jurisdiction means here has to be 7 understood in light of the whole phrase. And 8 Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is 9 all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent 10 jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase. 11 The whole phrase is, \"competent 12 jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had 13 been interpreted three times in three different 14 appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing 15 agency in the same statute, and that is the language 16 that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of 17 those appellate decisions at that time, every one of 18 them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent 19 jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction. 20 I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans 21 case, and the Seven Oaks case. 22 Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that 23 the language it was borrowing from another agency in the 24 same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would 25 restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n2 ',\n",

BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n9 make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n10 historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n11 Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n12 Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n13 statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n14 reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n15 time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n16 Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n17 was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n18 would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n19 here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n20 the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n21 language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n22 \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n23 been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n24 jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n2 jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n3 about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n4 interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n5 phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n6 Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n7 at the two phrases together.\\n\\n8 And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n9 \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n10 jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n11 jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n12 Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n13 ',\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n14 position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n15 you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n16 you\\'re home free.

And \"of competent\\n\\n20 jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n21 they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n22 MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n23 the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n24 \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n25 mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n30 1 So the three things we think competent 2 jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of 3 the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was 4 these three things. 5 So the first thing was, there was a very 6 vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature 7 of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they 8 were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard 9 in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard 10 generally in the district courts. This was the precise 11 question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add, 12 that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in 13 briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under 14 these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in 15 the Portsmouth case. Okay? 16 But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this 17 context was held to mean at that time was the direction 18 that general jurisdiction courts, and not only 19 specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case. 20 The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the 21 time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase, 22 later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State 23 court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of 24 Claims. And that issue was resolved. 25 The second thing --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n31 1 ',\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: Well, the court said 2 \"general jurisdiction,\" right? 3 MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did. 4 ',\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\" 5 instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when 6 \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the 7 sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to 8 sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed 9 to the Court. 10 Does this Court have authority to proceed in 11 this category of cases? 12 MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we 13 think all these things work together is, first of all, 14 as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent 15 jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously 16 held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right? 17 Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no 18 cases to the contrary at the time. 19 And the understanding of what \"competent 20 jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all, 21 from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s 22 fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because 23 the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of 24 Federal housing policy having very little to do with 25 jurisdiction.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n32 1 And we think what happened is they simply 2 borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to 3 confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae. 4 There was no other reason to think they meant anything 5 different from that. 6 But we also know that less than two years 7 before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this 8 Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a 9 standalone basis and said that all it referred to at 10 that time in that context was personal jurisdiction. 11 That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent 12 jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means 13 is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it 14 means personal jurisdiction courts of general 15 jurisdiction. 16 Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the 17 question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued 18 clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor, 19 that your clerk has. We have nine total, including 20 Fannie Mae. 21 ',\n",

So if the phrase \"competent 5 jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists 6 only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a 7 generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we 8 urge on this Court today. 9 The rule is, when combined with the grant of 10 jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red 11 Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general 12 jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the 13 grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and 14 its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional 15 rule that is very clean. 16 Now -17 CHIEF ',\n",

But just let me make sure I've closed off on the 2 Chief Justice's question, which is the fact that there's 3 no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for 4 Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie 5 Mae, its sister organization. 6 Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about 7 Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know 8 is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative 9 history in both the House Report and the Senate Report 10 make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to 11 create an entity that had identical powers that would 12 develop in parallel and that would have no advantage 13 over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in 14 drafting it. 15 Now, the words were unquestionably 16 different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter 17 were different from the words in the Second Bank of the 18 United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. 19 The reason the words were different at the 20 time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of 21 writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without 22 60 years of history, without the need to extricate a 23 legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization 24 scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit 25 down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 like.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n36\\n\\n2 \",\n",

That would make it\\n\\n14 clearer.\\n\\n15 But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n16 counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n17 created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n18 probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n19 an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n20 In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n21 authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n22 mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n23 sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n24 that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n25 to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n38 1 legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and 2 Chicago, and New York, and would start creating 3 liquidity to solve the problem. 4 So in 1938, a new statute was passed.

And to get into them you have 3 to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish 4 their right to be there. 5 Now, I think you have to do more than win 6 51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction. 7 Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more 8 than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration 9 that we need to take into account. 10 MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, 11 there's no question that the courts are limited 12 jurisdiction courts, and we should look at 13 subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye. 14 Having said that, this fundamentally is a 15 case about statutory construction. It's about what did 16 Congress mean to do in 1954. That's really all it's 17 about. I don't think there's a serious question but 18 that under Article III -19 \",\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways 20 that you could -- if you want to make sure that this 21 entity gets into Federal court all the time, what 22 Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will 23 be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and 24 removal purposes. 25 Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n40 1 come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove 2 if it\\'s sued in State court. 3 This, compared to \"court of competent 4 jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent 5 jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the 6 Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and 7 personal. 8 MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin 9 where you ended, if I might, and just say that this 10 Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase 11 \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay, 12 has multiple different meanings depending on context. 13 In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this 14 Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter 15 jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal 16 jurisdiction citing cases. 17 In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. 18 Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before 19 our statute was decided, it said that in that context, 20 the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. 21 So I think the only way to harmonize all of 22 these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction 23 is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross 24 language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the 25 other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n2 jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n3 holds.\\n\\n4 But the most --\\n\\n5 ',\n",
       " ' GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n6 Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n7 subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n8 personal.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n10 And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n11 intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n12 understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n13 had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n14 for 20 years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n15 verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n16 language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n17 subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n18 Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n19 years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n20 those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n21 any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n22 on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n23 Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n24 briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n25 the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n3 was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n4 company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n5 courts.\\n\\n6 The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n7 that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n8 owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n9 from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n10 there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n11 sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n12 Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n13 shareholders.\\n\\n14 Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n15 that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n16 its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n17 Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n18 course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n19 writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n20 that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n21 question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n22 pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n23 qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n24 But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n25 it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n43 1 in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not 2 privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even 3 when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954 4 Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it 5 still had special access to the Federal courts under 6 1345. 7 So if there had been a conscious legislative 8 judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at 9 that time, they surely would have had to do the work of 10 taking away its agency status. 11 ',\n",
       " \" GINSBURG: It shouldn't matter to 12 the Federal court. They can be there if there is 13 diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law. 14 MR. BROOKS: That's true, Your Honor. That 15 exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised 16 specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion 17 in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that 18 Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds. 19 And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not 20 being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove 21 on lots of grounds all the time. 22 And by the way -23 \",\n",
       " \" GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn't have 24 the competence language. It was just any court, State 25 or Federal.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n44 1 MR. BROOKS: That's true. But the point I 2 was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction 3 didn't have some negative implication for other sources, 4 and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful 5 evidence that that shouldn't matter. 6 Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and 7 suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued 8 in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -9 Freddie doesn't say competent jurisdiction. 10 But what else Freddie says is Freddie says 11 that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345 12 purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have 13 statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the 14 limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct 15 grounds for getting to Federal court. 16 \",\n",
       " \" SOTOMAYOR: So why didn't they do 17 that for Fannie Mae? 18 MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it's hard 19 to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of 20 the Framers of our charter. But the original charter 21 language was written in the '30s and '40s. It was 22 written at a time when we were connected with multiple 23 other agencies. We were part of the Department of 24 Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became 25 Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n45 1 essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this 2 big accretion of language over decades. 3 Freddie Mac didn't have that problem. So 4 Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting 5 from scratch. 6 I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's 7 colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would 8 happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute. 9 And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor 10 Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen. 11 We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language. We 12 want to add this competent jurisdiction language. 13 Now, that's only been looked at three times 14 before, and all of those cases said that confers 15 jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or 16 perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a 17 way of removing jurisdiction. 18 That doesn't sound plausible any more in 19 this case than it did in the prior case to me, given 20 what the case law backdrop was of the time. 21 Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point 22 about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you 23 know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac 24 has different language. The question is, is this a good 25 thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n46 1 Our view basically is Congress said what it 2 meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said 3 that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were 4 supposed to have no advantages over each other and have 5 all the same powers. 6 The question for this Court is: Why would 7 Congress -- although it used a different language across 8 multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac 9 to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same 10 securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC 11 exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit, 12 but have different Federal court litigating powers? 13 There's no answer to that. 14 And all we know is that in terms of the 15 Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what 16 we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only 17 much, much bigger. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to 18 imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest 19 company in the United States by assets, creating housing 20 across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been 21 intended not to be protected by Federal court 22 jurisdiction. 23 \",\n",

BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you 22 know. 23 Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know 24 the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was 25 written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n48 1 Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the 2 phrase first came from. And we know that that language 3 had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress 4 had no indication it could have meant anything else. We 5 know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the 6 Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase, 7 \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred 8 jurisdiction. 9 Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in 10 briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this 11 exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing 12 Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition 13 to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth 14 Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson, 15 the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates 16 jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what 17 we know. That has always been the understanding. 18 And if we didn\\'t have that history and we 19 didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently 20 on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn 21 and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we 22 know what it means. 23 The disruption that would be created in the 24 markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower 25 courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n2 appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n3 powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n4 CHIEF ',\n",

       " \" ROBERTS: Do you know why they 2 have that different structure on the board of directors? 3 MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and 4 it's interesting, I've actually personally spoken to 5 some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late 6 '60s, okay? They were all former government officials, 7 because Fannie was, in '68, being extricated from its 8 Federal agency role. 9 Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. 10 Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 11 1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn't. Fannie 12 Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be 13 torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That's why the original 14 board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of 15 Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD 16 Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general 17 counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that 18 time, and it took multiple years before they could be 19 extricated. There is just a history here, which makes 20 it different. 21 But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the 22 largest participant in the largest market in the U.S. 23 economy.

I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n15 cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n16 This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n17 language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n18 was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n19 right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n20 was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n21 Court addressed it?\\n\\n22 Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n23 simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n24 that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n25 Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n52 1 reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around 2 this proposition that it might actually mean other 3 things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it 4 means. 5 Fannie says it could mean personal 6 jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It 7 could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those 8 words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But 9 the bottom line is you need to commit to what that 10 meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by 11 interpreting those words to mean what this Court has 12 said of competent jurisdiction. 13 ',\n",
       " ' KAGAN: Well, suppose it means 14 personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute 16 says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has 17 personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or 18 Federal. 19 Well, the Federal Court of Claims has 20 personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a 21 grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is 22 that this now turns into a grant of Federal 23 subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of 24 jurisdiction to Fannie. 25 So what about the court of appeals cases\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n2 interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n3 they were not about Federal jurisdiction.

Cendant 5 Mortgage Corporation. 6 Mr. Rosenkranz. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 There is only one natural way to read the 12 language at issue here. A \"court of competent 13 jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source 14 of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court 15 has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start 16 with the plain language. 17 The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The 18 power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 19 \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\" 20 The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to 21 say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any 22 State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, 23 State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent 24 jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a 25 court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n4 1 examine the statutes creating that court and granting it 2 jurisdiction. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -4 you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is 5 this court competent to hear this controversy\" would 6 include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you 7 limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction? 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it 9 to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. 10 It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a 11 court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has 12 subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has 13 personal jurisdiction. 14 And the -- the cases that my friends rely 15 upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are 16 cases in which there was already subject-matter 17 jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a 18 minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter 19 jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those 20 cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction. 21 Now, five times this Court has interpreted 22 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote, 23 \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional 24 authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone; 25 this Court held that any reference to competent\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n3 unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n4 should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n5 respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n6 And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n7 map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n8 Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n9 require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n10 jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n11 which word modifies it.\\n\\n12 So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n13 to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n14 read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n15 State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n16 a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n18 does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n19 argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n20 of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n21 court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n22 capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n23 jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n24 That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n25 Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n6 1 Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction. 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice 3 Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is 4 to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that 5 Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I 6 quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued 7 provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if, 8 but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal 9 courts.\" 10 So you need a mention of Federal courts in 11 order to even have a conversation about whether the 12 \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is 13 not sufficient. 14 And so another way to think about it is, 15 sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court, 16 State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without 17 more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find 19 this pretty tough. I think that there are five major 20 cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux 21 is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent 22 jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the 23 Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here. 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n7 1 JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way. 2 And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it 3 comes out the other way. And so what I see going for 4 you is one page of legislative history which says, 5 explicitly, you\\'re right. 6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that 8 legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it? 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the 10 legislative history. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more 13 going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of 14 the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over 15 again, three times before this provision -- those words 16 were added to this provision. This Court interpreted 17 that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting 18 and said, it must point to an outside source of 19 authority. And our -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But 21 these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly 22 in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this 23 issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\" 24 And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X, 25 did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n8 1 means -- because it refers probably to specific courts 2 and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in 3 general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction. 4 It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued. 5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree 6 respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized 7 these cases. 8 So Osborn, if you wanted to write a 9 provision that parses the legislative language the way 10 Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It 11 says, sue and be sued in all State courts having 12 competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit 13 court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish 14 State courts. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is 18 the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical. 19 And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is 20 the word \"State and Federal\" -21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench, 22 Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or 23 Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t 25 figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n9\\n\\n2 situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n3 because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n4 And then when you --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n6 difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n7 from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n8 the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n9 authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n10 competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n11 How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n12 generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n13 courts?\\n\\n14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n15 answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n16 The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n17 that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n18 jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n19 is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n20 courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n22 presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n23 context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n24 personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n10\\n\\n2 jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n3 subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n4 question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n5 jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n6 harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n7 confines of the Court.\\n\\n8 But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n9 again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n10 statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n11 clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n12 State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n13 to every Federal court either.\\n\\n14 The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n15 The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n16 jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n17 are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n18 And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n19 take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n20 reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n21 modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n22 same word.\\n\\n23 And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n24 this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n25 Step 1 was the original enactment. It was\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n11 1 before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per 2 Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not 3 grant jurisdiction. 4 Step 2 was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been 5 decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite 6 of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember, 7 there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and 8 then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to 9 match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision 10 that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took 11 a right turn and added the words \"competent 12 jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for 13 example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on 14 other provisions of law.\" 15 Step 3 was 1974. After the shift to private 16 entity was consummated, Congress further amended the 17 charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity 18 jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal 19 jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no 20 longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction 21 in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose 22 for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed 23 Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of 24 Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of 25 jurisdiction and venue.\"\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n12 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to 2 keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else. 3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For 4 purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It 5 could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but 6 look to the venue provisions to figure out where the 7 suit is appropriately brought. 8 This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 9 Every court that has ever evaluated this language has 10 concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 11 Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the 12 only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen 13 times since this case was first briefed, and just last 14 Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that 15 this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t 16 need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued 17 clause that grants Federal jurisdiction. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a 19 belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can 20 rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession 21 that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction. 22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your 23 Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie. 24 So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and 25 Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n3 not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n4 Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n5 public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n6 Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n7 diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n8 Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n12 bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n13 not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n14 would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n15 and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n16 history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n17 it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n18 Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n19 the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n20 otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n21 But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n22 back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n23 something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n24 sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n25 because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n14 1 stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And 2 then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there 3 is add some old report that sort of seemed to support 4 the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of 5 legislative history here. 6 But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we 7 shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard 8 enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and 9 Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going? 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to 12 look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re 13 going to end up with a result that seems to be different 14 than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It 15 was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the 16 page of legislative history. It will be better for the 17 lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will 18 be simpler for them. 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that 21 I\\'m in. 22 Anything anybody wants to say to help me 23 would be welcome. 24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let 25 me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 white light is on.\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n3 need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n4 conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n5 got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n6 But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n7 find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n8 competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n9 is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n10 words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n11 other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n12 And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n13 concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n14 private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n15 I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n16 involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n17 State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n18 there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n19 cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n20 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n22 Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n24 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n25 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n16 1 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 2 it please the Court: 3 The government\\'s view is that the rule of 4 Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that 5 authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or 6 be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" 7 The best reading of that phrase in Fannie 8 Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to 9 sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is 10 vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of 11 law. 12 We think there is a plausible story for why 13 Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued 14 clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if 15 you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying, 16 the text of the statute should control. 17 The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell 18 Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity 19 may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State 20 or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that 21 Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the 22 Federal courts. 23 In this case, the Court should give Congress 24 the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language 25 \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n17 1 competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have 2 to look to some other provision of law to see if that 3 court is vested with jurisdiction. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -5 my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been 6 able to identify, eight other statutes that use the 7 \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language. 8 Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number 9 of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B, 10 are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes 11 may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie 12 Mae is? 13 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those 14 statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the 15 sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that 16 says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving 17 this entity. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one. 19 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you 21 mean. 22 MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by 23 this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of 24 the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the 25 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n18\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n3 would be --\\n\\n4 MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n5 have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n6 also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n7 But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n8 that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n9 Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n10 all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n11 or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n12 brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n13 can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n14 a party.\\n\\n15 I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n16 to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n17 cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n18 cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n19 There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n20 frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n21 State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n22 HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n23 leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n24 courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n25 the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 as in this case.\\n\\n19\\n\\n2 If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n3 which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n4 sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n5 jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n6 over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n7 the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n8 resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n9 borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n10 HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n11 clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n12 to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n13 over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n15 statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n16 Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n17 two --\\n\\n18 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n19 corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n21 the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n22 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n23 Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n24 clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n25 create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n20 1 there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross 2 about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued 3 clause. 4 I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely 5 advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as 6 in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter 7 jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued 8 clause, that you have to -9 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used 10 the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent 11 jurisdiction,\" was Osborn. 12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -13 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that? 14 MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think 15 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says, 16 \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any 17 circuit court of the United States.\" 18 So I think in that case what the Court said 19 was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on 20 all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use 21 the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it 22 referred to the Federal courts. It used that language 23 only with respect to the State courts. 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language 25 \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n21 1 It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case 2 was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as 3 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter 4 used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked 5 exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in 6 D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in 7 1954, Congress changed it to mean something different. 8 One of the main rationales of the court of 9 appeals in this case was that the -- the work that 10 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s 11 telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized 12 court, like a State traffic court or a Federal 13 bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase 14 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do 15 that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes 16 authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the 17 suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that 18 particular court. We are just asking for the same 19 analysis to be done with Federal district courts. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the 21 judgments that have been entered, reading this the way 22 the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split 23 jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? 24 What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t 25 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n22 1 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the 3 way you want us to read them. 4 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases 5 are already finished that res judicata would -- you 6 know, their -- those cases would still stand on their 7 own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to 8 say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases 9 could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or 10 removed to Federal court. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have 12 res judicata if you never had subject-matter 13 jurisdiction? 14 MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking 15 about a case where -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up 17 subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but 18 you can\\'t when you -19 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up 21 to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it 22 collaterally. 23 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if 24 these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are 25 still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n23 1 subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases 2 are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the 3 case and bring that up. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the 5 ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as 6 wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a 7 final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct 8 review, then you can\\'t collaterally review. 9 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice 10 Ginsburg. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of 13 competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look 14 at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you 15 could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for 16 the same rule in the Federal district courts. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language 18 that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or 19 Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and 20 they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you 21 want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say 22 \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in 23 State court; we want them to be in State court. 24 Have you found any that say just something 25 like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n24\\n\\n2 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n3 in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n4 Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n6 once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n7 jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n8 out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n9 getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n10 to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n11 the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n13 of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n14 JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n15 MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n16 phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n17 you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n18 court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n19 competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n20 The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n21 statutes --\\n\\n22 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n23 MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n24 asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n25 district courts.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n25 1 The Respondents refer to the Federal 2 district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but 3 just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal 4 district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You 5 cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a 6 Federal district court unless there is complete 7 diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in 8 controversy. 9 So that language, \"court of competent 10 jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the 11 statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether 12 this suit is authorized to be brought there. 13 There\\'s a few other textual points that I 14 think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is 15 that Section 1349 should be an important point of 16 reference. Congress established a general rule that 17 having a government charter is not enough to confer 18 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United 19 States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and 20 when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie 21 Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication 22 from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter 23 jurisdiction. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 25 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n26 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks. 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS 3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 4 MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 5 and may it please the Court: 6 The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong 7 and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench, 8 Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for 9 Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal 10 policy through the corporate form. 11 Now, when Congress expressly provides that a 12 federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue 13 and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction 14 under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and 15 their prodigy. 16 Congress can obviously displace that rule if 17 it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do 18 that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\" 19 as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that 20 rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding 21 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as 22 a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise 23 existed, particularly given the history of what was 24 going on. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n27 1 jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have 2 competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for 3 subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction? 4 That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means. 5 MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor, 6 what competent jurisdiction means here has to be 7 understood in light of the whole phrase. And 8 Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is 9 all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent 10 jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase. 11 The whole phrase is, \"competent 12 jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had 13 been interpreted three times in three different 14 appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing 15 agency in the same statute, and that is the language 16 that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of 17 those appellate decisions at that time, every one of 18 them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent 19 jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction. 20 I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans 21 case, and the Seven Oaks case. 22 Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that 23 the language it was borrowing from another agency in the 24 same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would 25 restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n3 the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n4 MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n6 different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n7 act.\\n\\n8 MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n9 make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n10 historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n11 Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n12 Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n13 statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n14 reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n15 time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n16 Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n17 was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n18 would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n19 here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n20 the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n21 language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n22 \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n23 been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n24 jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n2 jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n3 about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n4 interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n5 phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n6 Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n7 at the two phrases together.\\n\\n8 And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n9 \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n10 jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n11 jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n12 Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n14 position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n15 you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n16 you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n17 competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n18 don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n19 you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n20 jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n21 they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n22 MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n23 the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n24 \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n25 mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n30 1 So the three things we think competent 2 jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of 3 the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was 4 these three things. 5 So the first thing was, there was a very 6 vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature 7 of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they 8 were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard 9 in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard 10 generally in the district courts. This was the precise 11 question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add, 12 that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in 13 briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under 14 these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in 15 the Portsmouth case. Okay? 16 But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this 17 context was held to mean at that time was the direction 18 that general jurisdiction courts, and not only 19 specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case. 20 The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the 21 time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase, 22 later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State 23 court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of 24 Claims. And that issue was resolved. 25 The second thing --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n31 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said 2 \"general jurisdiction,\" right? 3 MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\" 5 instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when 6 \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the 7 sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to 8 sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed 9 to the Court. 10 Does this Court have authority to proceed in 11 this category of cases? 12 MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we 13 think all these things work together is, first of all, 14 as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent 15 jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously 16 held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right? 17 Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no 18 cases to the contrary at the time. 19 And the understanding of what \"competent 20 jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all, 21 from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s 22 fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because 23 the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of 24 Federal housing policy having very little to do with 25 jurisdiction.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n32 1 And we think what happened is they simply 2 borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to 3 confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae. 4 There was no other reason to think they meant anything 5 different from that. 6 But we also know that less than two years 7 before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this 8 Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a 9 standalone basis and said that all it referred to at 10 that time in that context was personal jurisdiction. 11 That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent 12 jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means 13 is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it 14 means personal jurisdiction courts of general 15 jurisdiction. 16 Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the 17 question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued 18 clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor, 19 that your clerk has. We have nine total, including 20 Fannie Mae. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three 22 versions, but that\\'s okay. 23 (Laughter.) 24 MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine. 25 (Laughter.)\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n33 1 MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know. 2 The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent 3 jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very 4 early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent 5 jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists 6 only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a 7 generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we 8 urge on this Court today. 9 The rule is, when combined with the grant of 10 jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red 11 Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general 12 jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the 13 grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and 14 its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional 15 rule that is very clean. 16 Now -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry. 18 MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going 19 to -- go ahead. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the 21 other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases 22 that are going to be added to the Federal docket. 23 Do you have an answer to that? 24 MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that, 25 Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n3 working hard enough.\\n\\n4 (Laughter.)\\n\\n5 MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n6 that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n7 Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n10 (Laughter.)\\n\\n11 MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n12 to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n13 Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n14 charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n15 belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n16 almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n17 has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n19 statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n20 Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n21 to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n22 didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n23 said --\\n\\n24 MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n25 couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n35 1 Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the 2 Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s 3 no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for 4 Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie 5 Mae, its sister organization. 6 Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about 7 Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know 8 is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative 9 history in both the House Report and the Senate Report 10 make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to 11 create an entity that had identical powers that would 12 develop in parallel and that would have no advantage 13 over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in 14 drafting it. 15 Now, the words were unquestionably 16 different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter 17 were different from the words in the Second Bank of the 18 United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. 19 The reason the words were different at the 20 time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of 21 writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without 22 60 years of history, without the need to extricate a 23 legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization 24 scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit 25 down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 like.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n36\\n\\n2 JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n3 talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n4 legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n5 says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n6 are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n7 we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n8 right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n9 may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n10 intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n11 know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n12 State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n13 I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n14 jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n15 natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n16 but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n17 the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n18 them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n19 if you want?\\n\\n20 MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n22 what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n23 look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n24 that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n25 MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 points.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n37\\n\\n2 So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n3 reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n4 \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n5 from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n6 State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n7 that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n8 jurisdiction.\\n\\n9 But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n10 you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n11 is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n12 And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n13 statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n14 clearer.\\n\\n15 But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n16 counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n17 created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n18 probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n19 an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n20 In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n21 authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n22 mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n23 sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n24 that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n25 to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n38 1 legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and 2 Chicago, and New York, and would start creating 3 liquidity to solve the problem. 4 So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That 5 was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley, 6 the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost 7 his re-election campaign. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume, 11 or perhaps hope. 12 But in any case, 1938 was a different 13 statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that 14 wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter 15 for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created 16 in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was 17 adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the 18 language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme 19 language. 20 So somebody has to prevail, either the 21 Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the 22 failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is 23 most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red 24 Cross. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n39 1 courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts 2 of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have 3 to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish 4 their right to be there. 5 Now, I think you have to do more than win 6 51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction. 7 Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more 8 than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration 9 that we need to take into account. 10 MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, 11 there\\'s no question that the courts are limited 12 jurisdiction courts, and we should look at 13 subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye. 14 Having said that, this fundamentally is a 15 case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did 16 Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s 17 about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but 18 that under Article III -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways 20 that you could -- if you want to make sure that this 21 entity gets into Federal court all the time, what 22 Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will 23 be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and 24 removal purposes. 25 Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n40 1 come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove 2 if it\\'s sued in State court. 3 This, compared to \"court of competent 4 jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent 5 jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the 6 Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and 7 personal. 8 MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin 9 where you ended, if I might, and just say that this 10 Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase 11 \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay, 12 has multiple different meanings depending on context. 13 In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this 14 Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter 15 jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal 16 jurisdiction citing cases. 17 In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. 18 Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before 19 our statute was decided, it said that in that context, 20 the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. 21 So I think the only way to harmonize all of 22 these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction 23 is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross 24 language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the 25 other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n2 jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n3 holds.\\n\\n4 But the most --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n6 Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n7 subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n8 personal.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n10 And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n11 intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n12 understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n13 had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n14 for 20 years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n15 verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n16 language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n17 subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n18 Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n19 years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n20 those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n21 any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n22 on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n23 Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n24 briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n25 the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n3 was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n4 company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n5 courts.\\n\\n6 The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n7 that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n8 owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n9 from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n10 there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n11 sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n12 Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n13 shareholders.\\n\\n14 Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n15 that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n16 its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n17 Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n18 course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n19 writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n20 that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n21 question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n22 pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n23 qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n24 But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n25 it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n43 1 in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not 2 privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even 3 when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954 4 Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it 5 still had special access to the Federal courts under 6 1345. 7 So if there had been a conscious legislative 8 judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at 9 that time, they surely would have had to do the work of 10 taking away its agency status. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to 12 the Federal court. They can be there if there is 13 diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law. 14 MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That 15 exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised 16 specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion 17 in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that 18 Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds. 19 And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not 20 being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove 21 on lots of grounds all the time. 22 And by the way -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have 24 the competence language. It was just any court, State 25 or Federal.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n44 1 MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I 2 was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction 3 didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources, 4 and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful 5 evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter. 6 Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and 7 suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued 8 in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -9 Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction. 10 But what else Freddie says is Freddie says 11 that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345 12 purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have 13 statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the 14 limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct 15 grounds for getting to Federal court. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do 17 that for Fannie Mae? 18 MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard 19 to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of 20 the Framers of our charter. But the original charter 21 language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was 22 written at a time when we were connected with multiple 23 other agencies. We were part of the Department of 24 Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became 25 Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n45 1 essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this 2 big accretion of language over decades. 3 Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So 4 Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting 5 from scratch. 6 I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s 7 colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would 8 happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute. 9 And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor 10 Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen. 11 We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We 12 want to add this competent jurisdiction language. 13 Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times 14 before, and all of those cases said that confers 15 jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or 16 perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a 17 way of removing jurisdiction. 18 That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in 19 this case than it did in the prior case to me, given 20 what the case law backdrop was of the time. 21 Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point 22 about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you 23 know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac 24 has different language. The question is, is this a good 25 thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n46 1 Our view basically is Congress said what it 2 meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said 3 that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were 4 supposed to have no advantages over each other and have 5 all the same powers. 6 The question for this Court is: Why would 7 Congress -- although it used a different language across 8 multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac 9 to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same 10 securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC 11 exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit, 12 but have different Federal court litigating powers? 13 There\\'s no answer to that. 14 And all we know is that in terms of the 15 Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what 16 we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only 17 much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to 18 imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest 19 company in the United States by assets, creating housing 20 across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been 21 intended not to be protected by Federal court 22 jurisdiction. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I 24 mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this 25 language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n47 1 It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there 2 is a human being who wrote it. 3 MR. BROOKS: Yeah. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come 5 from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know? 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired. 8 MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former 9 staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope 10 not. 11 Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We 12 know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t 13 created in nineteen -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words, 15 \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent 16 jurisdiction\" -17 MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\" 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\" 19 You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who 20 did this. 21 MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you 22 know. 23 Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know 24 the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was 25 written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n48 1 Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the 2 phrase first came from. And we know that that language 3 had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress 4 had no indication it could have meant anything else. We 5 know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the 6 Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase, 7 \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred 8 jurisdiction. 9 Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in 10 briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this 11 exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing 12 Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition 13 to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth 14 Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson, 15 the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates 16 jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what 17 we know. That has always been the understanding. 18 And if we didn\\'t have that history and we 19 didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently 20 on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn 21 and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we 22 know what it means. 23 The disruption that would be created in the 24 markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower 25 courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n2 appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n3 powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n5 reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n6 there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n7 is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n8 Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n9 Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n10 MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n11 unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n12 President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n13 2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n14 access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n15 registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n16 no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n17 and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n18 intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n19 I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n20 statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n21 imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n22 the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n23 Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n24 \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n25 they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n50 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they 2 have that different structure on the board of directors? 3 MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and 4 it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to 5 some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late 6 \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials, 7 because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its 8 Federal agency role. 9 Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. 10 Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 11 1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie 12 Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be 13 torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original 14 board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of 15 Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD 16 Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general 17 counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that 18 time, and it took multiple years before they could be 19 extricated. There is just a history here, which makes 20 it different. 21 But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the 22 largest participant in the largest market in the U.S. 23 economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers 24 and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because 25 the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n2 would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n3 isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n4 If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n5 you.\\n\\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n7 Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n11 Just a couple of points.\\n\\n12 First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n13 do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n14 seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n15 cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n16 This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n17 language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n18 was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n19 right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n20 was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n21 Court addressed it?\\n\\n22 Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n23 simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n24 that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n25 Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n52 1 reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around 2 this proposition that it might actually mean other 3 things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it 4 means. 5 Fannie says it could mean personal 6 jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It 7 could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those 8 words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But 9 the bottom line is you need to commit to what that 10 meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by 11 interpreting those words to mean what this Court has 12 said of competent jurisdiction. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means 14 personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute 16 says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has 17 personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or 18 Federal. 19 Well, the Federal Court of Claims has 20 personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a 21 grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is 22 that this now turns into a grant of Federal 23 subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of 24 jurisdiction to Fannie. 25 So what about the court of appeals cases\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n2 interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n3 they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n4 understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n5 there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n6 whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n7 court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n8 court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n10 position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n12 explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n13 the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n14 drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n15 did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n16 Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n17 If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n18 Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n19 differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n20 apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n21 supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n22 what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n23 were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n24 Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n25 So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n3 one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n4 held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n5 of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n6 jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n7 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n9 The case is submitted.\\n\\n10 (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the\\n\\n11 above-entitled matter was submitted.)\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial -

Cendant 5 Mortgage Corporation. 6 Mr. Rosenkranz. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 There is only one natural way to read the 12 language at issue here. A \"court of competent 13 jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source 14 of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court 15 has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start 16 with the plain language. 17 The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The 18 power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 19 \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\" 20 The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to 21 say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any 22 State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, 23 State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent 24 jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a 25 court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 1 examine the statutes creating that court and granting it 2 jurisdiction. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -4 you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is 5 this court competent to hear this controversy\" would 6 include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you 7 limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction? 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it 9 to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. 10 It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a 11 court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has 12 subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has 13 personal jurisdiction. 14 And the -- the cases that my friends rely 15 upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are 16 cases in which there was already subject-matter 17 jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a 18 minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter 19 jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those 20 cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction. 21 Now, five times this Court has interpreted 22 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote, 23 \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional 24 authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone; 25 this Court held that any reference to competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n3 unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n4 should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n5 respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n6 And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n7 map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n8 Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n9 require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n10 jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n11 which word modifies it.\\n\\n12 So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n13 to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n14 read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n15 State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n16 a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n18 does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n19 argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n20 of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n21 court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n22 capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n23 jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n24 That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n25 Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n6 1 Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction. 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice 3 Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is 4 to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that 5 Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I 6 quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued 7 provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if, 8 but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal 9 courts.\" 10 So you need a mention of Federal courts in 11 order to even have a conversation about whether the 12 \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is 13 not sufficient. 14 And so another way to think about it is, 15 sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court, 16 State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without 17 more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find 19 this pretty tough. I think that there are five major 20 cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux 21 is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent 22 jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the 23 Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here. 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n7 1 JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way. 2 And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it 3 comes out the other way. And so what I see going for 4 you is one page of legislative history which says, 5 explicitly, you\\'re right. 6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that 8 legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it? 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the 10 legislative history. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more 13 going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of 14 the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over 15 again, three times before this provision -- those words 16 were added to this provision. This Court interpreted 17 that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting 18 and said, it must point to an outside source of 19 authority. And our -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But 21 these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly 22 in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this 23 issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\" 24 And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X, 25 did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n8 1 means -- because it refers probably to specific courts 2 and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in 3 general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction. 4 It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued. 5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree 6 respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized 7 these cases. 8 So Osborn, if you wanted to write a 9 provision that parses the legislative language the way 10 Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It 11 says, sue and be sued in all State courts having 12 competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit 13 court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish 14 State courts. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is 18 the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical. 19 And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is 20 the word \"State and Federal\" -21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench, 22 Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or 23 Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t 25 figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n9\\n\\n2 situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n3 because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n4 And then when you --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n6 difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n7 from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n8 the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n9 authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n10 competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n11 How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n12 generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n13 courts?\\n\\n14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n15 answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n16 The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n17 that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n18 jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n19 is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n20 courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n22 presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n23 context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n24 personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n10\\n\\n2 jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n3 subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n4 question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n5 jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n6 harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n7 confines of the Court.\\n\\n8 But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n9 again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n10 statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n11 clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n12 State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n13 to every Federal court either.\\n\\n14 The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n15 The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n16 jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n17 are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n18 And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n19 take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n20 reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n21 modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n22 same word.\\n\\n23 And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n24 this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n25 Step 1 was the original enactment. It was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n11 1 before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per 2 Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not 3 grant jurisdiction. 4 Step 2 was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been 5 decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite 6 of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember, 7 there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and 8 then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to 9 match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision 10 that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took 11 a right turn and added the words \"competent 12 jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for 13 example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on 14 other provisions of law.\" 15 Step 3 was 1974. After the shift to private 16 entity was consummated, Congress further amended the 17 charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity 18 jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal 19 jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no 20 longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction 21 in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose 22 for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed 23 Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of 24 Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of 25 jurisdiction and venue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n12 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to 2 keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else. 3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For 4 purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It 5 could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but 6 look to the venue provisions to figure out where the 7 suit is appropriately brought. 8 This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 9 Every court that has ever evaluated this language has 10 concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 11 Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the 12 only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen 13 times since this case was first briefed, and just last 14 Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that 15 this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t 16 need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued 17 clause that grants Federal jurisdiction. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a 19 belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can 20 rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession 21 that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction. 22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your 23 Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie. 24 So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and 25 Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n3 not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n4 Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n5 public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n6 Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n7 diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n8 Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n12 bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n13 not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n14 would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n15 and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n16 history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n17 it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n18 Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n19 the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n20 otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n21 But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n22 back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n23 something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n24 sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n25 because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n14 1 stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And 2 then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there 3 is add some old report that sort of seemed to support 4 the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of 5 legislative history here. 6 But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we 7 shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard 8 enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and 9 Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going? 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to 12 look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re 13 going to end up with a result that seems to be different 14 than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It 15 was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the 16 page of legislative history. It will be better for the 17 lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will 18 be simpler for them. 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that 21 I\\'m in. 22 Anything anybody wants to say to help me 23 would be welcome. 24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let 25 me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 white light is on.\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n3 need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n4 conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n5 got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n6 But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n7 find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n8 competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n9 is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n10 words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n11 other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n12 And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n13 concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n14 private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n15 I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n16 involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n17 State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n18 there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n19 cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n20 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n22 Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n24 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n25 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n16 1 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 2 it please the Court: 3 The government\\'s view is that the rule of 4 Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that 5 authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or 6 be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" 7 The best reading of that phrase in Fannie 8 Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to 9 sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is 10 vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of 11 law. 12 We think there is a plausible story for why 13 Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued 14 clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if 15 you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying, 16 the text of the statute should control. 17 The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell 18 Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity 19 may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State 20 or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that 21 Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the 22 Federal courts. 23 In this case, the Court should give Congress 24 the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language 25 \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17 1 competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have 2 to look to some other provision of law to see if that 3 court is vested with jurisdiction. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -5 my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been 6 able to identify, eight other statutes that use the 7 \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language. 8 Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number 9 of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B, 10 are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes 11 may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie 12 Mae is? 13 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those 14 statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the 15 sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that 16 says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving 17 this entity. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one. 19 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you 21 mean. 22 MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by 23 this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of 24 the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the 25 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n18\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n3 would be --\\n\\n4 MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n5 have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n6 also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n7 But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n8 that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n9 Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n10 all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n11 or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n12 brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n13 can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n14 a party.\\n\\n15 I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n16 to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n17 cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n18 cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n19 There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n20 frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n21 State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n22 HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n23 leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n24 courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n25 the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 as in this case.\\n\\n19\\n\\n2 If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n3 which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n4 sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n5 jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n6 over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n7 the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n8 resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n9 borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n10 HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n11 clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n12 to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n13 over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n15 statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n16 Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n17 two --\\n\\n18 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n19 corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n21 the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n22 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n23 Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n24 clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n25 create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n20 1 there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross 2 about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued 3 clause. 4 I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely 5 advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as 6 in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter 7 jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued 8 clause, that you have to -9 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used 10 the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent 11 jurisdiction,\" was Osborn. 12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -13 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that? 14 MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think 15 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says, 16 \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any 17 circuit court of the United States.\" 18 So I think in that case what the Court said 19 was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on 20 all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use 21 the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it 22 referred to the Federal courts. It used that language 23 only with respect to the State courts. 24 D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language 25 \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n21 1 It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case 2 was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as 3 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter 4 used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked 5 exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in 6 D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in 7 1954, Congress changed it to mean something different. 8 One of the main rationales of the court of 9 appeals in this case was that the -- the work that 10 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s 11 telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized 12 court, like a State traffic court or a Federal 13 bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase 14 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do 15 that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes 16 authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the 17 suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that 18 particular court. We are just asking for the same 19 analysis to be done with Federal district courts. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the 21 judgments that have been entered, reading this the way 22 the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split 23 jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? 24 What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t 25 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22 1 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the 3 way you want us to read them. 4 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases 5 are already finished that res judicata would -- you 6 know, their -- those cases would still stand on their 7 own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to 8 say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases 9 could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or 10 removed to Federal court. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have 12 res judicata if you never had subject-matter 13 jurisdiction? 14 MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking 15 about a case where -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up 17 subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but 18 you can\\'t when you -19 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up 21 to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it 22 collaterally. 23 MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if 24 these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are 25 still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n23 1 subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases 2 are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the 3 case and bring that up. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the 5 ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as 6 wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a 7 final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct 8 review, then you can\\'t collaterally review. 9 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice 10 Ginsburg. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of 13 competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look 14 at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you 15 could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for 16 the same rule in the Federal district courts. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language 18 that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or 19 Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and 20 they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you 21 want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say 22 \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in 23 State court; we want them to be in State court. 24 Have you found any that say just something 25 like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n24\\n\\n2 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n3 in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n4 Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n6 once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n7 jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n8 out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n9 getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n10 to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n11 the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n12 MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n13 of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n14 JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n15 MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n16 phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n17 you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n18 court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n19 competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n20 The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n21 statutes --\\n\\n22 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n23 MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n24 asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n25 district courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n25 1 The Respondents refer to the Federal 2 district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but 3 just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal 4 district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You 5 cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a 6 Federal district court unless there is complete 7 diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in 8 controversy. 9 So that language, \"court of competent 10 jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the 11 statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether 12 this suit is authorized to be brought there. 13 There\\'s a few other textual points that I 14 think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is 15 that Section 1349 should be an important point of 16 reference. Congress established a general rule that 17 having a government charter is not enough to confer 18 Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United 19 States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and 20 when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie 21 Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication 22 from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter 23 jurisdiction. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 25 MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks. 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS 3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 4 MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 5 and may it please the Court: 6 The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong 7 and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench, 8 Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for 9 Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal 10 policy through the corporate form. 11 Now, when Congress expressly provides that a 12 federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue 13 and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction 14 under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and 15 their prodigy. 16 Congress can obviously displace that rule if 17 it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do 18 that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\" 19 as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that 20 rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding 21 the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as 22 a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise 23 existed, particularly given the history of what was 24 going on. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27 1 jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have 2 competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for 3 subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction? 4 That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means. 5 MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor, 6 what competent jurisdiction means here has to be 7 understood in light of the whole phrase. And 8 Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is 9 all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent 10 jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase. 11 The whole phrase is, \"competent 12 jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had 13 been interpreted three times in three different 14 appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing 15 agency in the same statute, and that is the language 16 that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of 17 those appellate decisions at that time, every one of 18 them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent 19 jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction. 20 I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans 21 case, and the Seven Oaks case. 22 Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that 23 the language it was borrowing from another agency in the 24 same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would 25 restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n3 the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n4 MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n6 different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n7 act.\\n\\n8 MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n9 make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n10 historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n11 Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n12 Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n13 statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n14 reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n15 time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n16 Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n17 was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n18 would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n19 here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n20 the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n21 language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n22 \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n23 been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n24 jurisdiction.\\n\\n25 Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n2 jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n3 about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n4 interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n5 phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n6 Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n7 at the two phrases together.\\n\\n8 And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n9 \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n10 jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n11 jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n12 Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n14 position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n15 you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n16 you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n17 competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n18 don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n19 you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n20 jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n21 they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n22 MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n23 the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n24 \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n25 mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30 1 So the three things we think competent 2 jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of 3 the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was 4 these three things. 5 So the first thing was, there was a very 6 vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature 7 of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they 8 were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard 9 in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard 10 generally in the district courts. This was the precise 11 question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add, 12 that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in 13 briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under 14 these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in 15 the Portsmouth case. Okay? 16 But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this 17 context was held to mean at that time was the direction 18 that general jurisdiction courts, and not only 19 specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case. 20 The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the 21 time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase, 22 later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State 23 court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of 24 Claims. And that issue was resolved. 25 The second thing --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said 2 \"general jurisdiction,\" right? 3 MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\" 5 instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when 6 \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the 7 sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to 8 sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed 9 to the Court. 10 Does this Court have authority to proceed in 11 this category of cases? 12 MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we 13 think all these things work together is, first of all, 14 as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent 15 jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously 16 held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right? 17 Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no 18 cases to the contrary at the time. 19 And the understanding of what \"competent 20 jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all, 21 from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s 22 fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because 23 the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of 24 Federal housing policy having very little to do with 25 jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32 1 And we think what happened is they simply 2 borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to 3 confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae. 4 There was no other reason to think they meant anything 5 different from that. 6 But we also know that less than two years 7 before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this 8 Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a 9 standalone basis and said that all it referred to at 10 that time in that context was personal jurisdiction. 11 That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent 12 jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means 13 is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it 14 means personal jurisdiction courts of general 15 jurisdiction. 16 Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the 17 question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued 18 clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor, 19 that your clerk has. We have nine total, including 20 Fannie Mae. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three 22 versions, but that\\'s okay. 23 (Laughter.) 24 MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine. 25 (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33 1 MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know. 2 The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent 3 jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very 4 early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent 5 jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists 6 only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a 7 generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we 8 urge on this Court today. 9 The rule is, when combined with the grant of 10 jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red 11 Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general 12 jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the 13 grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and 14 its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional 15 rule that is very clean. 16 Now -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry. 18 MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going 19 to -- go ahead. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the 21 other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases 22 that are going to be added to the Federal docket. 23 Do you have an answer to that? 24 MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that, 25 Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n3 working hard enough.\\n\\n4 (Laughter.)\\n\\n5 MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n6 that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n7 Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n10 (Laughter.)\\n\\n11 MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n12 to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n13 Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n14 charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n15 belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n16 almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n17 has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n19 statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n20 Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n21 to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n22 didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n23 said --\\n\\n24 MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n25 couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35 1 Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the 2 Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s 3 no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for 4 Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie 5 Mae, its sister organization. 6 Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about 7 Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know 8 is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative 9 history in both the House Report and the Senate Report 10 make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to 11 create an entity that had identical powers that would 12 develop in parallel and that would have no advantage 13 over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in 14 drafting it. 15 Now, the words were unquestionably 16 different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter 17 were different from the words in the Second Bank of the 18 United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. 19 The reason the words were different at the 20 time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of 21 writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without 22 60 years of history, without the need to extricate a 23 legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization 24 scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit 25 down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\n\\n\\n\\x0c1 like.\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n2 JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n3 talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n4 legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n5 says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n6 are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n7 we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n8 right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n9 may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n10 intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n11 know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n12 State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n13 I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n14 jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n15 natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n16 but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n17 the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n18 them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n19 if you want?\\n\\n20 MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n22 what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n23 look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n24 that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n25 MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c1 points.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n2 So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n3 reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n4 \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n5 from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n6 State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n7 that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n8 jurisdiction.\\n\\n9 But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n10 you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n11 is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n12 And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n13 statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n14 clearer.\\n\\n15 But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n16 counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n17 created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n18 probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n19 an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n20 In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n21 authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n22 mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n23 sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n24 that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n25 to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38 1 legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and 2 Chicago, and New York, and would start creating 3 liquidity to solve the problem. 4 So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That 5 was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley, 6 the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost 7 his re-election campaign. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume, 11 or perhaps hope. 12 But in any case, 1938 was a different 13 statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that 14 wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter 15 for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created 16 in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was 17 adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the 18 language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme 19 language. 20 So somebody has to prevail, either the 21 Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the 22 failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is 23 most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red 24 Cross. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39 1 courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts 2 of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have 3 to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish 4 their right to be there. 5 Now, I think you have to do more than win 6 51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction. 7 Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more 8 than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration 9 that we need to take into account. 10 MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, 11 there\\'s no question that the courts are limited 12 jurisdiction courts, and we should look at 13 subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye. 14 Having said that, this fundamentally is a 15 case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did 16 Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s 17 about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but 18 that under Article III -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways 20 that you could -- if you want to make sure that this 21 entity gets into Federal court all the time, what 22 Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will 23 be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and 24 removal purposes. 25 Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40 1 come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove 2 if it\\'s sued in State court. 3 This, compared to \"court of competent 4 jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent 5 jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the 6 Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and 7 personal. 8 MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin 9 where you ended, if I might, and just say that this 10 Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase 11 \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay, 12 has multiple different meanings depending on context. 13 In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this 14 Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter 15 jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal 16 jurisdiction citing cases. 17 In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. 18 Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before 19 our statute was decided, it said that in that context, 20 the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. 21 So I think the only way to harmonize all of 22 these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction 23 is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross 24 language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the 25 other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n2 jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n3 holds.\\n\\n4 But the most --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n6 Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n7 subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n8 personal.\\n\\n9 MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n10 And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n11 intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n12 understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n13 had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n14 for 20 years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n15 verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n16 language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n17 subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n18 Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n19 years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n20 those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n21 any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n22 on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n23 Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n24 briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n25 the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n3 was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n4 company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n5 courts.\\n\\n6 The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n7 that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n8 owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n9 from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n10 there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n11 sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n12 Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n13 shareholders.\\n\\n14 Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n15 that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n16 its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n17 Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n18 course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n19 writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n20 that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n21 question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n22 pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n23 qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n24 But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n25 it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43 1 in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not 2 privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even 3 when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954 4 Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it 5 still had special access to the Federal courts under 6 1345. 7 So if there had been a conscious legislative 8 judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at 9 that time, they surely would have had to do the work of 10 taking away its agency status. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to 12 the Federal court. They can be there if there is 13 diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law. 14 MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That 15 exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised 16 specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion 17 in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that 18 Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds. 19 And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not 20 being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove 21 on lots of grounds all the time. 22 And by the way -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have 24 the competence language. It was just any court, State 25 or Federal.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44 1 MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I 2 was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction 3 didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources, 4 and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful 5 evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter. 6 Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and 7 suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued 8 in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -9 Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction. 10 But what else Freddie says is Freddie says 11 that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345 12 purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have 13 statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the 14 limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct 15 grounds for getting to Federal court. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do 17 that for Fannie Mae? 18 MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard 19 to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of 20 the Framers of our charter. But the original charter 21 language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was 22 written at a time when we were connected with multiple 23 other agencies. We were part of the Department of 24 Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became 25 Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n45 1 essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this 2 big accretion of language over decades. 3 Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So 4 Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting 5 from scratch. 6 I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s 7 colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would 8 happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute. 9 And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor 10 Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen. 11 We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We 12 want to add this competent jurisdiction language. 13 Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times 14 before, and all of those cases said that confers 15 jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or 16 perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a 17 way of removing jurisdiction. 18 That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in 19 this case than it did in the prior case to me, given 20 what the case law backdrop was of the time. 21 Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point 22 about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you 23 know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac 24 has different language. The question is, is this a good 25 thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46 1 Our view basically is Congress said what it 2 meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said 3 that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were 4 supposed to have no advantages over each other and have 5 all the same powers. 6 The question for this Court is: Why would 7 Congress -- although it used a different language across 8 multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac 9 to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same 10 securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC 11 exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit, 12 but have different Federal court litigating powers? 13 There\\'s no answer to that. 14 And all we know is that in terms of the 15 Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what 16 we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only 17 much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to 18 imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest 19 company in the United States by assets, creating housing 20 across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been 21 intended not to be protected by Federal court 22 jurisdiction. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I 24 mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this 25 language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n47 1 It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there 2 is a human being who wrote it. 3 MR. BROOKS: Yeah. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come 5 from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know? 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired. 8 MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former 9 staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope 10 not. 11 Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We 12 know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t 13 created in nineteen -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words, 15 \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent 16 jurisdiction\" -17 MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\" 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\" 19 You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who 20 did this. 21 MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you 22 know. 23 Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know 24 the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was 25 written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48 1 Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the 2 phrase first came from. And we know that that language 3 had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress 4 had no indication it could have meant anything else. We 5 know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the 6 Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase, 7 \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred 8 jurisdiction. 9 Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in 10 briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this 11 exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing 12 Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition 13 to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth 14 Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson, 15 the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates 16 jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what 17 we know. That has always been the understanding. 18 And if we didn\\'t have that history and we 19 didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently 20 on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn 21 and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we 22 know what it means. 23 The disruption that would be created in the 24 markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower 25 courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n2 appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n3 powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n5 reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n6 there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n7 is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n8 Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n9 Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n10 MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n11 unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n12 President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n13 2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n14 access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n15 registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n16 no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n17 and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n18 intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n19 I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n20 statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n21 imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n22 the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n23 Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n24 \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n25 they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they 2 have that different structure on the board of directors? 3 MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and 4 it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to 5 some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late 6 \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials, 7 because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its 8 Federal agency role. 9 Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. 10 Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 11 1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie 12 Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be 13 torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original 14 board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of 15 Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD 16 Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general 17 counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that 18 time, and it took multiple years before they could be 19 extricated. There is just a history here, which makes 20 it different. 21 But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the 22 largest participant in the largest market in the U.S. 23 economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers 24 and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because 25 the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n2 would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n3 isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n4 If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n5 you.\\n\\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n7 Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n11 Just a couple of points.\\n\\n12 First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n13 do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n14 seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n15 cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n16 This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n17 language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n18 was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n19 right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n20 was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n21 Court addressed it?\\n\\n22 Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n23 simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n24 that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n25 Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52 1 reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around 2 this proposition that it might actually mean other 3 things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it 4 means. 5 Fannie says it could mean personal 6 jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It 7 could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those 8 words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But 9 the bottom line is you need to commit to what that 10 meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by 11 interpreting those words to mean what this Court has 12 said of competent jurisdiction. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means 14 personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute 16 says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has 17 personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or 18 Federal. 19 Well, the Federal Court of Claims has 20 personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a 21 grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is 22 that this now turns into a grant of Federal 23 subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of 24 jurisdiction to Fannie. 25 So what about the court of appeals cases\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n2 interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n3 they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n4 understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n5 there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n6 whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n7 court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n8 court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n10 position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n12 explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n13 the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n14 drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n15 did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n16 Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n17 If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n18 Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n19 differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n20 apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n21 supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n22 what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n23 were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n24 Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n25 So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n3 one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n4 held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n5 of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n6 jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n7 Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n9 The case is submitted.\\n\\n10 (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the\\n\\n11 above-entitled matter was submitted.)\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n\\n55\\n\\nA\\na.m

Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n \\n\\n  competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n  unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n  should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n  respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n  And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n  map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n  Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n  require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n  which word modifies it.\\n\\n  So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n  to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n  read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n  State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n  a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n  does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n  argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n  of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n  court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n  capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n  Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n \\n\\n  situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n  because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n  And then when you --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n  difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n  from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n  the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n  authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n  How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n  generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n  courts?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n  answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n  that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n  jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n  is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n  courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n  presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n  context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n  personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n \\n\\n  jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n  question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n  jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n  harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n  confines of the Court.\\n\\n  But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n  again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n  statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n  clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n  to every Federal court either.\\n\\n  The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n  are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n  And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n  take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n  reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n  modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n  same word.\\n\\n  And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n  this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n  Step   was the original enactment. It was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n \\n\\n  clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n  not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n  Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n  public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n  Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n  diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n  bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n  not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n  would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n  and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n  history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n  it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n  Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n  the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n  otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n  But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n  back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n  something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n  sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n  because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  white light is on.\\n\\n \\n\\n  And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n  need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n  conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n  got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n  But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n  find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n  is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n  words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n  other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n  And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n  concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n  private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n  I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n  involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n  State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n  there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n  cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n \\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n  would be --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n  have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n  also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n  But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n  that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n  Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n  all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n  or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n  brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n  can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n  a party.\\n\\n  I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n  to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n  cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n  cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n  There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n  frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n  State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n  HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n  leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n  courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n  the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  as in this case.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n  which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n  sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n  over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n  the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n  resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n  borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n  HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n  to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n  over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n  statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n  Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n  two --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n  corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n  the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n  Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n  create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n \\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n  in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n  Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n  once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n  out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n  getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n  to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n  the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n  of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n  phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n  you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n  court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n  statutes --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n  asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n  district courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n  the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n  different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n  act.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n  make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n  historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n  Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n  Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n  statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n  reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n  time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n  Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n  was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n  would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n  here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n  the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n  language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n  \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n  been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n  about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n  interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n  phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n  Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n  at the two phrases together.\\n\\n  And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n  Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n  position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n  you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n  you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n  don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n  you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n  they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n  the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n  mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n  working hard enough.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n  that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n  Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n  to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n  Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n  charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n  belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n  almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n  has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n  statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n  Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n  to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n  didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n  said --\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n  couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  like.\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n  talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n  legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n  says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n  are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n  we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n  right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n  may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n  intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n  know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n  State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n  I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n  natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n  but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n  the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n  them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n  if you want?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n  what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n  look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n  that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  points.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n  So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n  reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n  from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n  that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n  you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n  is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n  And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n  statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n  clearer.\\n\\n  But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n  counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n  created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n  probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n  an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n  In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n  authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n  mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n  sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n  that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n  to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n  jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n  holds.\\n\\n  But the most --\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n  Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n  subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n  personal.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n  And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n  intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n  understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n  had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n  for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n  verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n  language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n  Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n  years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n  those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n  any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n  on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n  Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n  briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n  the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n  that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n  was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n  company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n  courts.\\n\\n  The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n  that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n  owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n  from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n  there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n  sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n  Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n  shareholders.\\n\\n  Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n  that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n  its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n  Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n  course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n  writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n  that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n  question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n  pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n  qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n  But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n  it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n  appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n  powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n  reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n  there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n  is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n  Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n  unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n  President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n  2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n  access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n  registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n  no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n  and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n  intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n  I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n  statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n  imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n  the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n  Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n  \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n  they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n  would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n  isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n  If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n  you.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n  Just a couple of points.\\n\\n  First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n  do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n  seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n  cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n  This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n  language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n  was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n  right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n  was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n  Court addressed it?\\n\\n  Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n  simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n  that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n  Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n  interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n  they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n  understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n  there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n  whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n  court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n  court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n  position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n  explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n  the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n  drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n  did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n  Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n  Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n  differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n  apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n  supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n  what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n  were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n  Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n  So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n  course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n  one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n  held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n  of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n  jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  The case is submitted.\\n\\n  (Whereupon, at  :02 p.m., the case in the\\n\\n  above-entitled matter was submitted.)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n\\n55\\n\\nA\\na.m  :   :  ability

       " '   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n \\n\\n  competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n  unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n  should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n  respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n  And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n  map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n  Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n  require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n  which word modifies it.\\n\\n  So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n  to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n  read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n  State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n  a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n  does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n  argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n  of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n  court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n  capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n  Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n \\n\\n  situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n  because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n  And then when you --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n  difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n  from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n  the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n  authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n  How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n  generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n  courts?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n  answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n  that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n  jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n  is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n  courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n  presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n  context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n  personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n \\n\\n  jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n  question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n  jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n  harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n  confines of the Court.\\n\\n  But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n  again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n  statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n  clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n  to every Federal court either.\\n\\n  The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n  are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n  And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n  take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n  reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n  modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n  same word.\\n\\n  And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n  this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n  Step   was the original enactment. It was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n \\n\\n  clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n  not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n  Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n  public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n  Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n  diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n  bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n  not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n  would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n  and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n  history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n  it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n  Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n  the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n  otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n  But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n  back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n  something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n  sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n  because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  white light is on.\\n\\n \\n\\n  And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n  need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n  conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n  got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n  But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n  find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n  is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n  words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n  other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n  And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n  concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n  private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n  I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n  involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n  State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n  there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n  cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n \\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n  would be --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n  have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n  also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n  But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n  that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n  Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n  all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n  or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n  brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n  can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n  a party.\\n\\n  I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n  to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n  cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n  cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n  There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n  frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n  State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n  HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n  leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n  courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n  the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  as in this case.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n  which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n  sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n  over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n  the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n  resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n  borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n  HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n  to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n  over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n  statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n  Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n  two --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n  corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n  the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n  Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n  create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n \\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n  in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n  Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n  once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n  out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n  getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n  to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n  the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n  of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n  phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n  you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n  court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n  statutes --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n  asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n  district courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n  the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n  different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n  act.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n  make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n  historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n  Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n  Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n  statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n  reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n  time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n  Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n  was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n  would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n  here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n  the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n  language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n  \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n  been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n  about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n  interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n  phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n  Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n  at the two phrases together.\\n\\n  And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n  Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n  position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n  you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n  you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n  don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n  you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n  they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n  the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n  mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n  working hard enough.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n  that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n  Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n  to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n  Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n  charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n  belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n  almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n  has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n  statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n  Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n  to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n  didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n  said --\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n  couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  like.\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n  talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n  legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n  says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n  are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n  we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n  right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n  may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n  intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n  know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n  State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n  I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n  natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n  but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n  the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n  them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n  if you want?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n  what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n  look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n  that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  points.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n  So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n  reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n  from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n  that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n  you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n  is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n  And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n  statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n  clearer.\\n\\n  But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n  counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n  created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n  probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n  an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n  In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n  authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n  mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n  sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n  that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n  to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n  jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n  holds.\\n\\n  But the most --\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n  Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n  subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n  personal.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n  And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n  intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n  understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n  had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n  for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n  verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n  language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n  Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n  years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n  those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n  any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n  on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n  Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n  briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n  the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n  that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n  was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n  company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n  courts.\\n\\n  The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n  that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n  owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n  from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n  there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n  sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n  Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n  shareholders.\\n\\n  Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n  that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n  its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n  Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n  course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n  writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n  that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n  question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n  pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n  qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n  But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n  it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n  appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n  powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n  reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n  there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n  is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n  Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n  unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n  President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n  2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n  access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n  registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n  no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n  and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n  intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n  I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n  statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n  imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n  the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n  Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n  \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n  they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n  would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n  isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n  If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n  you.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n  Just a couple of points.\\n\\n  First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n  do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n  seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n  cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n  This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n  language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n  was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n  right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n  was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n  Court addressed it?\\n\\n  Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n  simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n  that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n  Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n  interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n  they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n  understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n  there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n  whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n  court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n  court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n  position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n  explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n  the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n  drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n  did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n  Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n  Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n  differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n  apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n  supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n  what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n  were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n  Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n  So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n  course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n  one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n  held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n  of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n  jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  The case is submitted.\\n\\n  (Whereupon, at  :02 p.m., the case in

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n \\n\\n  competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n  unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n  should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n  respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n  And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n  map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n  Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n  require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n  which word modifies it.\\n\\n  So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n  to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n  read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n  State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n  a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n  does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n  argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n  of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n  court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n  capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n  Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n \\n\\n  situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n  because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n  And then when you --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n  difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n  from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n  the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n  authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n  How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n  generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n  courts?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n  answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n  that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n  jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n  is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n  courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n  presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n  context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n  personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n \\n\\n  jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n  question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n  jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n  harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n  confines of the Court.\\n\\n  But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n  again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n  statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n  clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n  to every Federal court either.\\n\\n  The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n  are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n  And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n  take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n  reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n  modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n  same word.\\n\\n  And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n  this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n  Step   was the original enactment. It was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n \\n\\n  clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n  not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n  Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n  public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n  Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n  diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n  bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n  not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n  would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n  and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n  history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n  it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n  Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n  the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n  otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n  But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n  back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n  something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n  sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n  because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  white light is on.\\n\\n \\n\\n  And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n  need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n  conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n  got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n  But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n  find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n  is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n  words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n  other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n  And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n  concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n  private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n  I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n  involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n  State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n  there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n  cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n \\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n  would be --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n  have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n  also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n  But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n  that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n  Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n  all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n  or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n  brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n  can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n  a party.\\n\\n  I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n  to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n  cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n  cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n  There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n  frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n  State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n  HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n  leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n  courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n  the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  as in this case.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n  which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n  sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n  over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n  the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n  resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n  borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n  HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n  to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n  over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n  statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n  Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n  two --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n  corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n  the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n  Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n  create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n \\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n  in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n  Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n  once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n  out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n  getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n  to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n  the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n  of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n  phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n  you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n  court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n  statutes --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n  asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n  district courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n  the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n  different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n  act.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n  make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n  historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n  Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n  Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n  statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n  reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n  time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n  Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n  was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n  would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n  here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n  the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n  language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n  \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n  been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n  about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n  interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n  phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n  Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n  at the two phrases together.\\n\\n  And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n  Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n  position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n  you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n  you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n  don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n  you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n  they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n  the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n  mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n  working hard enough.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n  that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n  Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n  to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n  Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n  charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n  belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n  almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n  has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n  statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n  Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n  to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n  didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n  said --\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n  couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  like.\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n  talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n  legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n  says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n  are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n  we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n  right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n  may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n  intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n  know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n  State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n  I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n  natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n  but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n  the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n  them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n  if you want?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n  what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n  look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n  that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  points.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n  So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n  reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n  from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n  that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n  you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n  is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n  And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n  statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n  clearer.\\n\\n  But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n  counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n  created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n  probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n  an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n  In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n  authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n  mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n  sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n  that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n  to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n  jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n  holds.\\n\\n  But the most --\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n  Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n  subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n  personal.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n  And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n  intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n  understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n  had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n  for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n  verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n  language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n  Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n  years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n  those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n  any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n  on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n  Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n  briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n  the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n  that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n  was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n  company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n  courts.\\n\\n  The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n  that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n  owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n  from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n  there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n  sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n  Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n  shareholders.\\n\\n  Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n  that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n  its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n  Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n  course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n  writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n  that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n  question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n  pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n  qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n  But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n  it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n  appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n  powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n  reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n  there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n  is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n  Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n  unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n  President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n  2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n  access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n  registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n  no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n  and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n  intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n  I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n  statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n  imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n  the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n  Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n  \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n  they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n  would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n  isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n  If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n  you.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n  Just a couple of points.\\n\\n  First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n  do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n  seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n  cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n  This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n  language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n  was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n  right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n  was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n  Court addressed it?\\n\\n  Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n  simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n  that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n  Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n  interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n  they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n  understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n  there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n  whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n  court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n  court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n  position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n  explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n  the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n  drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n  did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n  Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n  Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n  differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n  apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n  supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n  what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n  were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n  Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n  So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n  course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n  one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n  held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n  of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n  jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  The case is submitted.\\n\\n  (Whereupon, at  :02 p.m., the case in

       "['   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n \\n\\n  competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n  unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n  should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n  respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n  And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n  map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n  Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n  require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n  which word modifies it.\\n\\n  So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n  to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n  read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n  State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n  a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n  does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n  argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n  of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n  court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n  capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n  Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n \\n\\n  situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n  because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n  And then when you --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n  difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n  from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n  the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n  authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n  How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n  generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n  courts?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n  answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n  that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n  jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n  is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n  courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n  presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n  context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n  personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n \\n\\n  jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n  question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n  jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n  harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n  confines of the Court.\\n\\n  But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n  again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n  statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n  clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n  to every Federal court either.\\n\\n  The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n  are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n  And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n  take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n  reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n  modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n  same word.\\n\\n  And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n  this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n  Step   was the original enactment. It was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n \\n\\n  clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n  not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n  Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n  public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n  Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n  diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n  bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n  not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n  would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n  and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n  history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n  it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n  Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n  the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n  otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n  But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n  back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n  something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n  sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n  because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  white light is on.\\n\\n \\n\\n  And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n  need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n  conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n  got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n  But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n  find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n  is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n  words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n  other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n  And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n  concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n  private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n  I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n  involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n  State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n  there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n  cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n \\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n  would be --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n  have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n  also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n  But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n  that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n  Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n  all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n  or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n  brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n  can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n  a party.\\n\\n  I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n  to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n  cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n  cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n  There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n  frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n  State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n  HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n  leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n  courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n  the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  as in this case.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n  which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n  sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n  over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n  the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n  resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n  borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n  HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n  to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n  over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n  statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n  Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n  two --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n  corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n  the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n  Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n  create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n \\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n  in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n  Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n  once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n  out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n  getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n  to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n  the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n  of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n  phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n  you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n  court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n  statutes --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n  asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n  district courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n  the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n  different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n  act.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n  make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n  historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n  Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n  Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n  statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n  reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n  time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n  Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n  was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n  would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n  here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n  the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n  language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n  \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n  been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n  about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n  interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n  phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n  Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n  at the two phrases together.\\n\\n  And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n  Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n  position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n  you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n  you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n  don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n  you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n  they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n  the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n  mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n  working hard enough.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n  that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n  Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n  to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n  Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n  charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n  belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n  almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n  has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n  statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n  Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n  to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n  didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n  said --\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n  couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  like.\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n  talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n  legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n  says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n  are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n  we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n  right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n  may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n  intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n  know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n  State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n  I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n  natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n  but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n  the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n  them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n  if you want?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n  what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n  look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n  that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  points.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n  So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n  reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n  from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n  that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n  you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n  is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n  And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n  statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n  clearer.\\n\\n  But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n  counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n  created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n  probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n  an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n  In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n  authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n  mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n  sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n  that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n  to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n  jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n  holds.\\n\\n  But the most --\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n  Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n  subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n  personal.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n  And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n  intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n  understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n  had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n  for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n  verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n  language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n  Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n  years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n  those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n  any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n  on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n  Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n  briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n  the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n  that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n  was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n  company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n  courts.\\n\\n  The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n  that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n  owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n  from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n  there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n  sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n  Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n  shareholders.\\n\\n  Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n  that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n  its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n  Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n  course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n  writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n  that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n  question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n  pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n  qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n  But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n  it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n  appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n  powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n  reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n  there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n  is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n  Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n  unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n  President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n  2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n  access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n  registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n  no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n  and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n  intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n  I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n  statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n  imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n  the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n  Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n  \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n  they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n  would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n  isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n  If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n  you.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n  Just a couple of points.\\n\\n  First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n  do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n  seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n  cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n  This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n  language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n  was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n  right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n  was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n  Court addressed it?\\n\\n  Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n  simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n  that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n  Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n  interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n  they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n  understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n  there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n  whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n  court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n  court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n  position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n  explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n  the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n  drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n  did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n  Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n  Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n  differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n  apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n  supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n  what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n  were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n  Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n  So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n  course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n  one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n  held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n  of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n  jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  ',\n",

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to\\n\\n \\n\\n  competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it\\n\\n  unquestionably meant that the competency of the court\\n\\n  should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in\\n\\n  respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"\\n\\n  And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not\\n\\n  map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.\\n\\n  Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would\\n\\n  require the Court to read the phrase \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon\\n\\n  which word modifies it.\\n\\n  So Fannie concedes that the clause referring\\n\\n  to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be\\n\\n  read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A\\n\\n  State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to\\n\\n  a statutory authority for the State.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what\\n\\n  does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n  argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n  of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n  court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n  capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n  Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a\\n\\n \\n\\n  situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction\\n\\n  because there was an arising-under clause.\\n\\n  And then when you --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a\\n\\n  difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n  from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n  the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n  authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n  How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n  generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n  courts?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the\\n\\n  answer is that provision -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of\\n\\n  that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question\\n\\n  jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause\\n\\n  is a clause that provides for the direction as to which\\n\\n  courts you go into. And the same is true --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n  presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n  context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n  personal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  disagree. It is personal and subject-matter\\n\\n \\n\\n  jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal\\n\\n  question under 1331. Show me where there is personal\\n\\n  jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit\\n\\n  harder. Make sure that the person is within the\\n\\n  confines of the Court.\\n\\n  But -- but I would also say just mapping,\\n\\n  again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the\\n\\n  statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this\\n\\n  clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction\\n\\n  to every Federal court either.\\n\\n  The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.\\n\\n  The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements\\n\\n  are otherwise satisfied.\\n\\n  And Fannie has never explained how you can\\n\\n  take the same language and map it out differently to\\n\\n  reach different results depending upon which word it\\n\\n  modifies and even different results when it modifies the\\n\\n  same word.\\n\\n  And the statutory evolution also confirms\\n\\n  this. It unfolded in three critical steps.\\n\\n  Step   was the original enactment. It was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n \\n\\n  clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --\\n\\n  not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and\\n\\n  Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is\\n\\n  public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a\\n\\n  Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the\\n\\n  diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really\\n\\n  bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n  not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n  would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n  and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n  history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n  it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n  Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n  the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n  otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n  But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n  back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n  something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n  sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n  because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  white light is on.\\n\\n \\n\\n  And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You\\n\\n  need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a\\n\\n  conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve\\n\\n  got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.\\n\\n  But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you\\n\\n  find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that\\n\\n  is -- that has held that those words, those precise\\n\\n  words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything\\n\\n  other than what this Court has held it means.\\n\\n  And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply\\n\\n  concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going\\n\\n  private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.\\n\\n  I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is\\n\\n  involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in\\n\\n  State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that\\n\\n  there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure\\n\\n  cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Ms. O\\'Connell.\\n\\n  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL\\n\\n  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n \\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question\\n\\n  would be --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies\\n\\n  have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They\\n\\n  also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.\\n\\n  But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean\\n\\n  that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a\\n\\n  Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then\\n\\n  all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party\\n\\n  or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be\\n\\n  brought in Federal court against the agency, and they\\n\\n  can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is\\n\\n  a party.\\n\\n  I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given\\n\\n  to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these\\n\\n  cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure\\n\\n  cases. They are quintessential State court questions.\\n\\n  There can be a case -- and this happens\\n\\n  frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in\\n\\n  State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if\\n\\n  HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to\\n\\n  leave that case in the State court where the State\\n\\n  courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all\\n\\n  the time. They are all State law causes of action, just\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  as in this case.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If the Court were to say that the language\\n\\n  which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be\\n\\n  sued in any State or Federal court of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter\\n\\n  over that suit, then the private party can now remove\\n\\n  the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the\\n\\n  resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the\\n\\n  borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.\\n\\n  HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not\\n\\n  to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction\\n\\n  over any case involving HUD.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five\\n\\n  statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n  Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n  two --\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal\\n\\n  corporations, federally chartered corporations.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read\\n\\n  the statute in the same way you have?\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh\\n\\n  Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued\\n\\n  clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to\\n\\n  create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?\\n\\n \\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be\\n\\n  in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,\\n\\n  Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,\\n\\n  once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n  out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n  getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n  to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n  the English language, it just seems a little tough.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter\\n\\n  of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: It is.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that\\n\\n  phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that\\n\\n  you have to look somewhere else to determine if the\\n\\n  court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n  The Court has observed that about various\\n\\n  statutes --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\\n\\n  MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just\\n\\n  asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal\\n\\n  district courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  history shows the distinction.\\n\\n28\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n  the same thing in Ginnie Mae?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very\\n\\n  different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n  act.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me\\n\\n  make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae\\n\\n  historically has had the identical language to Fannie\\n\\n  Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\\n\\n  Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54\\n\\n  statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the\\n\\n  reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that\\n\\n  time, was truly a Federal agency.\\n\\n  Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,\\n\\n  was transitioning into a new structure, right? There\\n\\n  would eventually be private ownership. And the idea\\n\\n  here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what\\n\\n  the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA\\n\\n  language, the language that had been interpreted in the\\n\\n  \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had\\n\\n  been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent\\n\\n29\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand\\n\\n  about those cases is the number of those five cases that\\n\\n  interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the\\n\\n  phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not\\n\\n  Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked\\n\\n  at the two phrases together.\\n\\n  And when counsel argues that the phrase\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of\\n\\n  jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the\\n\\n  Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your\\n\\n  position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n  you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n  you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n  competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n  don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n  you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n  they don\\'t mean anything.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\\n\\n  the context of the late New Deal era, the words\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t\\n\\n  mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  The easiest answer is no --\\n\\n34\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not\\n\\n  working hard enough.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n  that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.\\n\\n  Maybe foreclosures could be among them.\\n\\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.\\n\\n  (Laughter.)\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer\\n\\n  to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that\\n\\n  Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae\\n\\n  charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed\\n\\n  belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has\\n\\n  almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There\\n\\n  has been no race to the Federal courthouse.\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific\\n\\n  statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n  Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n  to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n  didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n  said --\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a\\n\\n  couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  like.\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to\\n\\n  talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n  legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n  says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n  are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n  we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n  right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n  may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n  intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n  know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n  State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n  I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n  jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n  natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n  but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n  the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n  them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n  if you want?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --\\n\\n  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --\\n\\n  what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n  look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n  that. What -- what should I do?\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c  points.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n  So first of all, on the -- on the natural\\n\\n  reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of\\n\\n  \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different\\n\\n  from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"\\n\\n  State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,\\n\\n  that holds those words together, don\\'t confer\\n\\n  jurisdiction.\\n\\n  But now, on the question about what was --\\n\\n  you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there\\n\\n  is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.\\n\\n  And that respect is if the colloquy related to the\\n\\n  statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it\\n\\n  clearer.\\n\\n  But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that\\n\\n  counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that\\n\\n  created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more\\n\\n  probative than if it had been the legislative history of\\n\\n  an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?\\n\\n  In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress\\n\\n  authorized the creation of entirely different private\\n\\n  mortgage associations which never came into being. The\\n\\n  sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was\\n\\n  that private capital would come into the market pursuant\\n\\n  to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general\\n\\n41\\n\\n  jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law\\n\\n  holds.\\n\\n  But the most --\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this\\n\\n  Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n  subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n  personal.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n  And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'\\n\\n  intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to\\n\\n  understand is when Congress borrowed this language that\\n\\n  had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration\\n\\n  for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its\\n\\n  verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that\\n\\n  language had held it was sufficient to confer\\n\\n  subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the\\n\\n  Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six\\n\\n  years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that\\n\\n  those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in\\n\\n  any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry\\n\\n  on which Congress was weaving at the time.\\n\\n  Now, let me address, if I might just\\n\\n  briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and\\n\\n  the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  about this privatization concept and how it would be\\n\\n42\\n\\n  that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress\\n\\n  was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private\\n\\n  company and deprive it of special access to the Federal\\n\\n  courts.\\n\\n  The presumption behind that argument is\\n\\n  that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately\\n\\n  owned company to have special access, except we know\\n\\n  from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that\\n\\n  there are times when a privately owned company is\\n\\n  sufficiently important, it can have special access. The\\n\\n  Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private\\n\\n  shareholders.\\n\\n  Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know\\n\\n  that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at\\n\\n  its inception with clear and undisputed access to the\\n\\n  Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of\\n\\n  course, because it was writing in a different era and\\n\\n  writing on a different slate without all the baggage\\n\\n  that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no\\n\\n  question that privately owned instrumentalities when\\n\\n  pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can\\n\\n  qualify under these circumstances.\\n\\n  But the other problem with their theory if\\n\\n  it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  the same result, at least three in the courts of\\n\\n49\\n\\n  appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different\\n\\n  powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a\\n\\n  reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests\\n\\n  there was a reason for treating them differently, which\\n\\n  is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of\\n\\n  Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that\\n\\n  Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.\\n\\n  MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,\\n\\n  unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the\\n\\n  President of the United States until conservatorship in\\n\\n  2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury\\n\\n  access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC\\n\\n  registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is\\n\\n  no material policy different between these two agencies,\\n\\n  and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\\n\\n  intent to treat these the same.\\n\\n  I will say that since 1974, every GSE\\n\\n  statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\\n\\n  imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\\n\\n  the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\\n\\n  Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\\n\\n  \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why\\n\\n  they would have wanted these treated differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,\\n\\n51\\n\\n  would be a significant policy shift that we would argue\\n\\n  isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.\\n\\n  If there are no further questions, thank\\n\\n  you.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.\\n\\n  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n\\n  Just a couple of points.\\n\\n  First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What\\n\\n  do you do when the language points one way and the cases\\n\\n  seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the\\n\\n  cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:\\n\\n  This Court has never gone wrong by going with the\\n\\n  language, and in those previous cases, what the Court\\n\\n  was trying to do in each case was go with the language,\\n\\n  right down to Red Cross where the operative principle\\n\\n  was: What did this very language mean last time this\\n\\n  Court addressed it?\\n\\n  Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is\\n\\n  simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute\\n\\n  that our reading is a natural reading of the language.\\n\\n  Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not\\n\\n53\\n\\n  interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and\\n\\n  they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone\\n\\n  understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that\\n\\n  there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was\\n\\n  whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district\\n\\n  court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal\\n\\n  court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.\\n\\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n  position in Portsmouth?\\n\\n  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t\\n\\n  explain the position that the government has taken, but\\n\\n  the government has said that those were also kind of\\n\\n  drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\\n\\n  did not involve the question of what is the source of\\n\\n  Federal jurisdiction.\\n\\n  If I may, one last point on Fannie and\\n\\n  Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\\n\\n  differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\\n\\n  apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\\n\\n  supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\\n\\n  what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\\n\\n  were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\\n\\n  Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\\n\\n  So Congress said, we are not giving them any\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n  advantage. But case after case has held that, of\\n\\n54\\n\\n  course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\\n\\n  one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\\n\\n  held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\\n\\n  of cases have held that there was no automatic\\n\\n  jurisdiction for Fannie.\\n\\n  Thank you, Your Honors.\\n\\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n  '"

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to   \\x0c     examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent   \\x0c   jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what    does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your    argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning    \\x0c     Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --   \\x0c     JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this   \\x0c     means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because   \\x0c   it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a       situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction    because there was an arising-under clause.    And then when you --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a    difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision    from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do    the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which    authorizes suit in any Federal district court of    competent jurisdiction.    How do you deal with the fact that the ADA    generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal    courts?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the    answer is that provision -- excuse me.    The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of    that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question    jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause    is a clause that provides for the direction as to which    courts you go into. And the same is true --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m    presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in    context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as    personal jurisdiction.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I    \\x0c   disagree. It is personal and subject-matter       jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has    subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was    \\x0c     before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"   \\x0c     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,   \\x0c   it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued       clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --    not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and    Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is    public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a    Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the    diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to    Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --    JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.    JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really    bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or    not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I    would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,    and particularly when you have that page of legislative    history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave    it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want    Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all    the time. We just want them to have the right when they    otherwise would be in Federal court.    But when I finished reading the cases, going    back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is    something of a rule here. It may not make too much    sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --    because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even    \\x0c     stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my   \\x0c   white light is on.       And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You    need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a    conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve    got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.    But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you    find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of    competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that    is -- that has held that those words, those precise    words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything    other than what this Court has held it means.    And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that    there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure    cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Ms. O\\'Connell.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL    FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS    \\x0c     MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of   \\x0c     competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the   \\x0c   Department of Veterans Affairs.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question    would be --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies    have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They    also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.    But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean    that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a    Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then    all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party    or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be    brought in Federal court against the agency, and they    can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is    a party.    I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just    \\x0c   as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.    HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued    clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not    to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction    over any case involving HUD.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five    statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve    Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the    two --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal    corporations, federally chartered corporations.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read    the statute in the same way you have?    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh    Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued    clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to    create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think    \\x0c     there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.   \\x0c     It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?   \\x0c     MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up   \\x0c     subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or   \\x0c   Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?       MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be    in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,    Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --    JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,    once you added these words \"in any competent    jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case    out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for    getting there and require you to go to State court, and    to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of    the English language, it just seems a little tough.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter    of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.    JUSTICE BREYER: It is.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that    phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that    you have to look somewhere else to determine if the    court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of    competent jurisdiction.\"    The Court has observed that about various    statutes --    JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just    asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal    district courts.    \\x0c     The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.   \\x0c 26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent   \\x0c 27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that   \\x0c   history shows the distinction.  28    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do    the same thing in Ginnie Mae?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very    different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious    act.    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me    make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae    historically has had the identical language to Fannie    Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this    \\x0c   Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of    jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the    Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your    position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as    you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"    you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of    competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They    don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets    you into Federal court. And \"of competent    jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and    they don\\'t mean anything.    MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in    the context of the late New Deal era, the words    \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t    mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?    \\x0c 30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --   \\x0c 31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.   \\x0c 32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)   \\x0c 33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.   \\x0c   The easiest answer is no --  34    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not    working hard enough.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,    that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.    Maybe foreclosures could be among them.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.    MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer    to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that    Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae    charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed    belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has    almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There    has been no race to the Federal courthouse.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific    statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if    Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,    to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why    didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it    said --    MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a    couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie    \\x0c 35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look   \\x0c  like.    36    JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to    talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of    legislative history, which could not be more clear. It    says exactly what the government says. It says -- they    are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t    we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the    right to go into a Federal court, although the matter    may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --    JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --    what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t    look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say    that. What -- what should I do?    MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two    \\x0c  points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the    \\x0c 38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal   \\x0c 39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can   \\x0c 40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally   \\x0c   means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this    Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is    personal.    MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking    \\x0c   about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails    \\x0c 43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.   \\x0c 44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do   \\x0c 45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?   \\x0c 46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.   \\x0c 47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing   \\x0c 48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to   \\x0c   the same result, at least three in the courts of  49    appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different    powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a    reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests    there was a reason for treating them differently, which    is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of    Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that    Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.    MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,    unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the    President of the United States until conservatorship in    2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury    access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC    registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,    Congress has never treated one differently, not in the    \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why    they would have wanted these treated differently.    \\x0c 50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history   \\x0c   differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.    If there are no further questions, thank    you.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.    Just a couple of points.    First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What    do you do when the language points one way and the cases    seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the    cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:    This Court has never gone wrong by going with the    language, and in those previous cases, what the Court    was trying to do in each case was go with the language,    right down to Red Cross where the operative principle    was: What did this very language mean last time this    Court addressed it?    Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural    \\x0c 52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases   \\x0c   that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not  53    interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and    they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone    understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that    there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was    whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district    court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal    court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s    position in Portsmouth?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t    explain the position that the government has taken, but    the government has said that those were also kind of    drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply    did not involve the question of what is the source of    Federal jurisdiction.    If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They    were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting    Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.    So Congress said, we are not giving them any    \\x0c   advantage. But case after case has held that, of  54    course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just    one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have    held, before this case came along -- the vast majority    of cases have held that there was no automatic    jurisdiction for Fannie.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    '"

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what    does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your    argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning         Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --        JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this        means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because      it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a       situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction    because there was an arising-under clause.    And then when you --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a    difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision    from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do    the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which    authorizes suit in any Federal district court of    competent jurisdiction.    How do you deal with the fact that the ADA    generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal    courts?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the    answer is that provision -- excuse me.    The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of    that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question    jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause    is a clause that provides for the direction as to which    courts you go into. And the same is true --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m    presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in    context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as    personal jurisdiction.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I       disagree. It is personal and subject-matter       jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has    subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,      it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued       clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --    not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and    Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is    public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a    Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the    diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to    Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --    JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.    JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really    bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or    not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I    would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,    and particularly when you have that page of legislative    history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave    it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want    Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all    the time. We just want them to have the right when they    otherwise would be in Federal court.    But when I finished reading the cases, going    back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is    something of a rule here. It may not make too much    sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --    because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even         stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my      white light is on.       And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You    need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a    conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve    got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.    But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you    find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of    competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that    is -- that has held that those words, those precise    words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything    other than what this Court has held it means.    And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that    there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure    cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Ms. O\\'Connell.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL    FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS         MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of        competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the      Department of Veterans Affairs.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question    would be --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies    have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They    also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.    But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean    that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a    Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then    all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party    or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be    brought in Federal court against the agency, and they    can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is    a party.    I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just       as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.    HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued    clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not    to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction    over any case involving HUD.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five    statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve    Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the    two --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal    corporations, federally chartered corporations.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read    the statute in the same way you have?    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh    Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued    clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to    create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think         there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.        It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?        MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up        subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or      Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?       MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be    in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,    Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --    JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,    once you added these words \"in any competent    jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case    out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for    getting there and require you to go to State court, and    to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of    the English language, it just seems a little tough.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter    of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.    JUSTICE BREYER: It is.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that    phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that    you have to look somewhere else to determine if the    court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of    competent jurisdiction.\"    The Court has observed that about various    statutes --    JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just    asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal    district courts.         The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.    26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent    27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do    the same thing in Ginnie Mae?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very    different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious    act.    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me    make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae    historically has had the identical language to Fannie    Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of    jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the    Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your    position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as    you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"    you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of    competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They    don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets    you into Federal court. And \"of competent    jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and    they don\\'t mean anything.    MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in    the context of the late New Deal era, the words    \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t    mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?     30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --    31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)    33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.      The easiest answer is no --  34    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not    working hard enough.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,    that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.    Maybe foreclosures could be among them.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.    MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer    to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that    Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae    charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed    belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has    almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There    has been no race to the Federal courthouse.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific    statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if    Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,    to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why    didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it    said --    MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a    couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie     35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36    JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to    talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of    legislative history, which could not be more clear. It    says exactly what the government says. It says -- they    are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t    we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the    right to go into a Federal court, although the matter    may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --    JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --    what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t    look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say    that. What -- what should I do?    MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two      points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal    39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can    40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this    Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is    personal.    MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.    44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.    47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing    48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to      the same result, at least three in the courts of  49    appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different    powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a    reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests    there was a reason for treating them differently, which    is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of    Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that    Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.    MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,    unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the    President of the United States until conservatorship in    2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury    access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC    registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,    Congress has never treated one differently, not in the    \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why    they would have wanted these treated differently.     50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.    If there are no further questions, thank    you.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.    Just a couple of points.    First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What    do you do when the language points one way and the cases    seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the    cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:    This Court has never gone wrong by going with the    language, and in those previous cases, what the Court    was trying to do in each case was go with the language,    right down to Red Cross where the operative principle    was: What did this very language mean last time this    Court addressed it?    Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural     52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases      that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not  53    interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and    they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone    understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that    there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was    whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district    court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal    court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s    position in Portsmouth?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t    explain the position that the government has taken, but    the government has said that those were also kind of    drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply    did not involve the question of what is the source of    Federal jurisdiction.    If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They    were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting    Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.    So Congress said, we are not giving them any       advantage. But case after case has held that, of  54    course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just    one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have    held, before this case came along -- the vast majority    of cases have held that there was no automatic    jurisdiction for Fannie.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    '"

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.      MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what    does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your    argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning         Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --        JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this        means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because      it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a       situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction    because there was an arising-under clause.    And then when you --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a    difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision    from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do    the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which    authorizes suit in any Federal district court of    competent jurisdiction.    How do you deal with the fact that the ADA    generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal    courts?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the    answer is that provision -- excuse me.    The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of    that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question    jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause    is a clause that provides for the direction as to which    courts you go into. And the same is true --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m    presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in    context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as    personal jurisdiction.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I       disagree. It is personal and subject-matter       jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has    subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,      it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued       clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --    not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and    Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is    public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a    Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the    diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to    Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --    JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.    JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really    bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or    not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I    would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,    and particularly when you have that page of legislative    history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave    it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want    Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all    the time. We just want them to have the right when they    otherwise would be in Federal court.    But when I finished reading the cases, going    back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is    something of a rule here. It may not make too much    sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --    because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even         stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my      white light is on.       And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You    need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a    conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve    got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.    But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you    find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of    competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that    is -- that has held that those words, those precise    words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything    other than what this Court has held it means.    And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that    there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure    cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Ms. O\\'Connell.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL    FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS         MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of        competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the      Department of Veterans Affairs.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question    would be --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies    have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They    also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.    But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean    that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a    Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then    all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party    or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be    brought in Federal court against the agency, and they    can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is    a party.    I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just       as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.    HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued    clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not    to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction    over any case involving HUD.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five    statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve    Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the    two --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal    corporations, federally chartered corporations.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read    the statute in the same way you have?    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh    Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued    clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to    create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think         there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.        It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?        MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up        subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or      Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?       MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be    in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,    Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --    JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,    once you added these words \"in any competent    jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case    out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for    getting there and require you to go to State court, and    to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of    the English language, it just seems a little tough.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter    of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.    JUSTICE BREYER: It is.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that    phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that    you have to look somewhere else to determine if the    court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of    competent jurisdiction.\"    The Court has observed that about various    statutes --    JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just    asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal    district courts.         The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.    26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent    27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do    the same thing in Ginnie Mae?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very    different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious    act.    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me    make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae    historically has had the identical language to Fannie    Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of    jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the    Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your    position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as    you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"    you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of    competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They    don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets    you into Federal court. And \"of competent    jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and    they don\\'t mean anything.    MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in    the context of the late New Deal era, the words    \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t    mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?     30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --    31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)    33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.      The easiest answer is no --  34    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not    working hard enough.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,    that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.    Maybe foreclosures could be among them.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.    MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer    to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that    Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae    charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed    belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has    almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There    has been no race to the Federal courthouse.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific    statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if    Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,    to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why    didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it    said --    MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a    couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie     35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36    JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to    talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of    legislative history, which could not be more clear. It    says exactly what the government says. It says -- they    are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t    we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the    right to go into a Federal court, although the matter    may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --    JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --    what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t    look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say    that. What -- what should I do?    MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two      points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal    39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can    40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this    Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is    personal.    MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.    44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.    47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing    48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to      the same result, at least three in the courts of  49    appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different    powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a    reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests    there was a reason for treating them differently, which    is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of    Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that    Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.    MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,    unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the    President of the United States until conservatorship in    2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury    access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC    registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,    Congress has never treated one differently, not in the    \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why    they would have wanted these treated differently.     50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.    If there are no further questions, thank    you.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.    Just a couple of points.    First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What    do you do when the language points one way and the cases    seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the    cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:    This Court has never gone wrong by going with the    language, and in those previous cases, what the Court    was trying to do in each case was go with the language,    right down to Red Cross where the operative principle    was: What did this very language mean last time this    Court addressed it?    Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural     52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases      that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not  53    interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and    they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone    understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that    there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was    whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district    court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal    court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s    position in Portsmouth?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t    explain the position that the government has taken, but    the government has said that those were also kind of    drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply    did not involve the question of what is the source of    Federal jurisdiction.    If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They    were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting    Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.    So Congress said, we are not giving them any       advantage. But case after case has held that, of  54    course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just    one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have    held, before this case came along -- the vast majority    of cases have held that there was no automatic    jurisdiction for Fannie.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    '"

ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what    does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your    argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning         Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --        JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this        means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because      it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a       situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction    because there was an arising-under clause.    And then when you --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a    difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision    from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do    the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which    authorizes suit in any Federal district court of    competent jurisdiction.    How do you deal with the fact that the ADA    generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal    courts?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the    answer is that provision -- excuse me.    The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of    that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question    jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause    is a clause that provides for the direction as to which    courts you go into. And the same is true --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m    presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in    context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as    personal jurisdiction.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I       disagree. It is personal and subject-matter       jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has    subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,      it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued       clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --    not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and    Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is    public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a    Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the    diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to    Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --    JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.    JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really    bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or    not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I    would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,    and particularly when you have that page of legislative    history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave    it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want    Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all    the time. We just want them to have the right when they    otherwise would be in Federal court.    But when I finished reading the cases, going    back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is    something of a rule here. It may not make too much    sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --    because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even         stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my      white light is on.       And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You    need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a    conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve    got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.    But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you    find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of    competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that    is -- that has held that those words, those precise    words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything    other than what this Court has held it means.    And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that    there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure    cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Ms. O\\'Connell.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\\'CONNELL    FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS         MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of        competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the      Department of Veterans Affairs.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question    would be --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies    have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They    also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.    But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean    that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a    Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then    all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party    or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be    brought in Federal court against the agency, and they    can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is    a party.    I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just       as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.    HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued    clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not    to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction    over any case involving HUD.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five    statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve    Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the    two --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal    corporations, federally chartered corporations.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read    the statute in the same way you have?    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh    Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued    clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to    create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think         there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.        It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?        MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up        subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or      Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?       MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be    in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,    Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --    JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,    once you added these words \"in any competent    jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case    out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for    getting there and require you to go to State court, and    to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of    the English language, it just seems a little tough.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter    of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.    JUSTICE BREYER: It is.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that    phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that    you have to look somewhere else to determine if the    court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of    competent jurisdiction.\"    The Court has observed that about various    statutes --    JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just    asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal    district courts.         The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.    26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent    27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do    the same thing in Ginnie Mae?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very    different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious    act.    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me    make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae    historically has had the identical language to Fannie    Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of    jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the    Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your    position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as    you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"    you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of    competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They    don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets    you into Federal court. And \"of competent    jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and    they don\\'t mean anything.    MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in    the context of the late New Deal era, the words    \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t    mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?     30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --    31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)    33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.      The easiest answer is no --  34    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not    working hard enough.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,    that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.    Maybe foreclosures could be among them.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.    MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer    to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that    Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae    charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed    belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has    almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There    has been no race to the Federal courthouse.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific    statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if    Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,    to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why    didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it    said --    MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a    couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie     35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36    JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to    talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of    legislative history, which could not be more clear. It    says exactly what the government says. It says -- they    are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t    we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the    right to go into a Federal court, although the matter    may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --    JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --    what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t    look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say    that. What -- what should I do?    MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two      points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal    39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can    40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this    Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is    personal.    MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.    44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.    47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing    48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to      the same result, at least three in the courts of  49    appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different    powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a    reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests    there was a reason for treating them differently, which    is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of    Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that    Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.    MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,    unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the    President of the United States until conservatorship in    2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury    access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC    registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,    Congress has never treated one differently, not in the    \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why    they would have wanted these treated differently.     50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.    If there are no further questions, thank    you.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.        MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.    Just a couple of points.    First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What    do you do when the language points one way and the cases    seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the    cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:    This Court has never gone wrong by going with the    language, and in those previous cases, what the Court    was trying to do in each case was go with the language,    right down to Red Cross where the operative principle    was: What did this very language mean last time this    Court addressed it?    Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural     52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases      that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not  53    interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and    they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone    understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that    there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was    whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district    court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal    court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s    position in Portsmouth?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t    explain the position that the government has taken, but    the government has said that those were also kind of    drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply    did not involve the question of what is the source of    Federal jurisdiction.    If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They    were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting    Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.    So Congress said, we are not giving them any       advantage. But case after case has held that, of  54    course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just    one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have    held, before this case came along -- the vast majority    of cases have held that there was no automatic    jurisdiction for Fannie.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    '"

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.      MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what    does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your    argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning         Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --        JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this        means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because      it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a       situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction    because there was an arising-under clause.    And then when you --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a    difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision    from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do    the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which    authorizes suit in any Federal district court of    competent jurisdiction.    How do you deal with the fact that the ADA    generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal    courts?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the    answer is that provision -- excuse me.    The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of    that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question    jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause    is a clause that provides for the direction as to which    courts you go into. And the same is true --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m    presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in    context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as    personal jurisdiction.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I       disagree. It is personal and subject-matter       jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has    subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,      it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued       clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --    not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and    Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is    public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a    Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the    diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to    Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --    JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.    JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really    bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or    not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I    would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,    and particularly when you have that page of legislative    history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave    it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want    Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all    the time. We just want them to have the right when they    otherwise would be in Federal court.    But when I finished reading the cases, going    back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is    something of a rule here. It may not make too much    sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --    because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even         stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my      white light is on.       And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You    need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a    conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve    got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.    But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you    find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of    competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that    is -- that has held that those words, those precise    words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything    other than what this Court has held it means.    And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that    there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure    cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Ms. O\\'Connell.             MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of        competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the      Department of Veterans Affairs.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question    would be --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies    have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They    also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.    But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean    that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a    Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then    all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party    or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be    brought in Federal court against the agency, and they    can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is    a party.    I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just       as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.    HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued    clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not    to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction    over any case involving HUD.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five    statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve    Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the    two --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal    corporations, federally chartered corporations.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read    the statute in the same way you have?    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh    Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued    clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to    create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think         there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.        It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?        MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up        subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or      Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?       MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be    in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,    Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --    JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,    once you added these words \"in any competent    jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case    out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for    getting there and require you to go to State court, and    to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of    the English language, it just seems a little tough.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter    of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.    JUSTICE BREYER: It is.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that    phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that    you have to look somewhere else to determine if the    court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of    competent jurisdiction.\"    The Court has observed that about various    statutes --    JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just    asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal    district courts.         The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.    26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   MR. BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent    27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do    the same thing in Ginnie Mae?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very    different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious    act.    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me    make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae    historically has had the identical language to Fannie    Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of    jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the    Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your    position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as    you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"    you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of    competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They    don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets    you into Federal court. And \"of competent    jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and    they don\\'t mean anything.    MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in    the context of the late New Deal era, the words    \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t    mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?     30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --    31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)    33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.      The easiest answer is no --  34    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not    working hard enough.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,    that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.    Maybe foreclosures could be among them.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.    MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer    to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that    Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae    charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed    belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has    almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There    has been no race to the Federal courthouse.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific    statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if    Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,    to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why    didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it    said --    MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a    couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie     35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36    JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to    talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of    legislative history, which could not be more clear. It    says exactly what the government says. It says -- they    are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t    we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the    right to go into a Federal court, although the matter    may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --    JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --    what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t    look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say    that. What -- what should I do?    MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two      points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal    39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can    40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this    Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is    personal.    MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.    44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.    47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing    48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to      the same result, at least three in the courts of  49    appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different    powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a    reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests    there was a reason for treating them differently, which    is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of    Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that    Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.    MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,    unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the    President of the United States until conservatorship in    2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury    access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC    registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,    Congress has never treated one differently, not in the    \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why    they would have wanted these treated differently.     50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.    If there are no further questions, thank    you.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.        MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.    Just a couple of points.    First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What    do you do when the language points one way and the cases    seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the    cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:    This Court has never gone wrong by going with the    language, and in those previous cases, what the Court    was trying to do in each case was go with the language,    right down to Red Cross where the operative principle    was: What did this very language mean last time this    Court addressed it?    Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural     52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases      that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not  53    interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and    they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone    understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that    there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was    whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district    court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal    court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s    position in Portsmouth?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t    explain the position that the government has taken, but    the government has said that those were also kind of    drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply    did not involve the question of what is the source of    Federal jurisdiction.    If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They    were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting    Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.    So Congress said, we are not giving them any       advantage. But case after case has held that, of  54    course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just    one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have    held, before this case came along -- the vast majority    of cases have held that there was no automatic    jurisdiction for Fannie.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    '"

       "'   ( :04 a.m.)   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear   argument next in Case No.  -1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant   Mortgage Corporation.   Mr. Rosenkranz.      MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief   Justice, and may it please the Court:   There is only one natural way to read the   language at issue here. A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include -  you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is   this court competent to hear this controversy\" would   include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you   limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did you do -- what    does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your    argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning         Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Understood, Justice   Ginsburg. And I think the way to look at Red Cross is   to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that   Justice Souter was describing. The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: It\\'s tough. I mean, I find   this pretty tough. I think that there are five major   cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux   is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent   jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the   Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the   D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --        JUSTICE BREYER: It comes out the other way.   And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it   comes out the other way. And so what I see going for   you is one page of legislative history which says,   explicitly, you\\'re right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to deny that   legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no. I accept the   legislative history.   JUSTICE BREYER: Right.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: But we have a lot more   going for us than that. This Court\\'s interpretation of   the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction\" over and over   again, three times before this provision -- those words   were added to this provision. This Court interpreted   that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting   and said, it must point to an outside source of   authority. And our -  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that\\'s true. But   these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly   in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this   issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"   And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,   did say that the language, absolutely clear, this        means -- because it refers probably to specific courts   and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in   general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.   It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I disagree   respectfully with how they -- how you\\'ve characterized   these cases.   So Osborn, if you wanted to write a   provision that parses the legislative language the way   Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision. It   says, sue and be sued in all State courts having   competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit   court of the United States. That\\'s how you distinguish   State courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I got that one.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.   JUSTICE BREYER: D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is   the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.   And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is   the word \"State and Federal\" -  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, D\\'Oench,   Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or   Federal. This Court did not analyze this provision in   D\\'Oench, Duhme, and so there\\'s nothing -- we can\\'t   figure out what this Court was saying in D\\'Oench because      it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a       situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction    because there was an arising-under clause.    And then when you --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, is there a    difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision    from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do    the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which    authorizes suit in any Federal district court of    competent jurisdiction.    How do you deal with the fact that the ADA    generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal    courts?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so the    answer is that provision -- excuse me.    The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of    that jurisdiction. There is Federal-question    jurisdiction under the ADEA. The sue-or-be-sued clause    is a clause that provides for the direction as to which    courts you go into. And the same is true --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there, I\\'m    presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in    context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as    personal jurisdiction.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I       disagree. It is personal and subject-matter       jurisdiction. It means, show me where the Court has    subject-matter jurisdiction. Easy. There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that\\'s arguably to   keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. \"For   purposes of venue\" doesn\\'t mean all suits are in D.C. It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction. So a dozen   times since this case was first briefed, and just last   Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that   this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction. You don\\'t   need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued   clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\\'s just a   belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me. They can   rely on diversity jurisdiction. It\\'s not a concession   that they don\\'t have general Federal jurisdiction.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- understood, Your   Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie.   So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and   Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now,      it\\'s -- it\\'s the same charter. The sue-and-be-sued       clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --    not same language in separate provisions. Ginnie and    Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is    public. Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a    Federal agency. Congress in 1974 does not add the    diversity provision to Ginnie\\'s charter, only to    Fannie\\'s charter. And I do think --    JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.    MR. ROSENKRANZ: No. No. Please go ahead.    JUSTICE BREYER: This is what\\'s really    bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or    not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I    would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,    and particularly when you have that page of legislative    history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave    it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want    Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all    the time. We just want them to have the right when they    otherwise would be in Federal court.    But when I finished reading the cases, going    back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is    something of a rule here. It may not make too much    sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --    because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even         stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And   then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there   is add some old report that sort of seemed to support   the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of   legislative history here.   But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we   shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard   enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and   Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: So I don\\'t know whether to   look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re   going to end up with a result that seems to be different   than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It   was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the   page of legislative history. It will be better for the   lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will   be simpler for them.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.   JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the dilemma that   I\\'m in.   Anything anybody wants to say to help me   would be welcome.   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. Let   me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my      white light is on.       And so, look, this is perfectly simple. You    need the word \"Federal\" in order to even have a    conversation about Federal jurisdiction. If all you\\'ve    got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough.    But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you    find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, \"court of    competent jurisdiction,\" there is no case out there that    is -- that has held that those words, those precise    words, \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" means anything    other than what this Court has held it means.    And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court. If all of a sudden this Court says that    there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure    cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Ms. O\\'Connell.             MS. O\\'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may   it please the Court:   The government\\'s view is that the rule of   Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that   authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or   be sued in a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"   The best reading of that phrase in Fannie   Mae\\'s charter is that it authorizes the corporation to   sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is   vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of   law.   We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of        competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'ve done -- or had -  my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been   able to identify, eight other statutes that use the   \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.   Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number   of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,   are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes   may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie   Mae is?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- I am aware of those   statutes. I have on my list seven that just have the   sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that   says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving   this entity.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are off by one.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what you   mean.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So, no, I am not troubled by   this. In fact, I think this is the reason, two of   the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the   Department of Housing and Urban Development and the      Department of Veterans Affairs.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a Federal question    would be --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, the Federal agencies    have the power to bring a suit in Federal court. They    also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.    But if the Court interpret\\'s Fannie\\'s charter to mean    that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a    Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then    all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party    or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be    brought in Federal court against the agency, and they    can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is    a party.    I\\'ll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just       as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD\\'s charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.    HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued    clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not    to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction    over any case involving HUD.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those are five    statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve    Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the    two --    MS. O\\'CONNELL: Yes. They are Federal    corporations, federally chartered corporations.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have all of them read    the statute in the same way you have?    MS. O\\'CONNELL: I know that the Seventh    Circuit has interpreted the V.A.\\'s sue-and-be-sued    clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to    create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction. I think         there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross   about the Federal Home Loan Bank\\'s sue-and-be-sued   clause.   I don\\'t -- the -- we are definitely   advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as   in Fannie Mae\\'s charter, that Federal subject-matter   jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued   clause, that you have to -  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the one that used   the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent   jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Right, but it -  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do about that?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: But in -- in Osborn, I think   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,   \"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any   circuit court of the United States.\"   So I think in that case what the Court said   was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on   all circuit courts of the United States. It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.        It\\'s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case   was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as   Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\\'s charter   used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked   exactly the same as the FDIC\\'s, which the Court said in   D\\'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in   1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.   One of the main rationales of the court of   appeals in this case was that the -- the work that   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\\'s   telling you that you can\\'t file suit in a specialized   court, like a State traffic court or a Federal   bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase   \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do   that is because you\\'ve got to look at the statutes   authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the   suit that\\'s being brought can be brought in that   particular court. We are just asking for the same   analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to all the   judgments that have been entered, reading this the way   the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split   jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?   What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?        MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think that if -  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we read things the   way you want us to read them.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I would think if those cases   are already finished that res judicata would -- you   know, their -- those cases would still stand on their   own. But I think going forward, if the Court were to   say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases   could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or   removed to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you have   res judicata if you never had subject-matter   jurisdiction?   MS. O\\'CONNELL: So -- so you\\'re talking   about a case where -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can bring up   subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but   you can\\'t when you -  MS. O\\'CONNELL: Once the case is -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- haven\\'t brought it up   to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it   collaterally.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: I -- correct. If -- if   these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are   still going on, then, yes, you could bring up        subject-matter jurisdiction, I believe. If the cases   are over there is no way that I know of to reopen the   case and bring that up.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: I forgot the name of the   ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as   wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a   final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct   review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Correct. Thank you, Justice   Ginsburg.   (Laughter.)   MS. O\\'CONNELL: The -- the words \"court of   competent jurisdiction\" in the statute tell you to look   at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you   could bring a claim there. And we are just asking for   the same rule in the Federal district courts.   JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess language   that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or   Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and   they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you   want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say   \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in   State court; we want them to be in State court.   Have you found any that say just something   like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or      Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?       MS. O\\'CONNELL: Well, those -- those can be    in Federal court, per the Court\\'s decisions in D\\'Oench,    Duhme and in Red Cross. If that\\'s the way --    JUSTICE BREYER: But what we have to say is,    once you added these words \"in any competent    jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case    out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for    getting there and require you to go to State court, and    to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of    the English language, it just seems a little tough.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: No, no. I think as a matter    of an English language that\\'s our strongest point.    JUSTICE BREYER: It is.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: That natural reading of that    phrase, a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" means that    you have to look somewhere else to determine if the    court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a \"court of    competent jurisdiction.\"    The Court has observed that about various    statutes --    JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.    MS. O\\'CONNELL: -- and -- and we are just    asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal    district courts.         The Respondents refer to the Federal   district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but   just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal   district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.   So that language, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" should just tell you, look at the   statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether   this suit is authorized to be brought there.   There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.   MS. O\\'CONNELL: Thank you.    26   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brooks.   : Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,   and may it please the Court:   The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong   and long-standing rule going back through D\\'Oench,   Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for   Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal   policy through the corporate form.   Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency. But adding   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" is pretty weak tea as   a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise   existed, particularly given the history of what was   going on.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is competent    27   jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have   competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for   subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?   That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.   MR. BROOKS: Right. So -- so, Your Honor,   what competent jurisdiction means here has to be   understood in light of the whole phrase. And   Petitioners\\' case, as you just heard it presented, is   all about the idea that the only phrase is \"competent   jurisdiction.\" That is not the whole phrase.   The whole phrase is, \"competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" That entire phrase had   been interpreted three times in three different   appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing   agency in the same statute, and that is the language   that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954. Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why didn\\'t they do    the same thing in Ginnie Mae?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Ginnie --    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They chose very    different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious    act.    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me    make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae    historically has had the identical language to Fannie    Mae. Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right. The separate source of    jurisdiction is the phrase \"State or Federal\" if the    Court\\'s rule in Red Cross means anything.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -- your    position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as    you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"    you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of    competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They    don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets    you into Federal court. And \"of competent    jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and    they don\\'t mean anything.    MR. BROOKS: Well, actually, Your Honor, in    the context of the late New Deal era, the words    \"competent jurisdiction\" meant a lot. They just don\\'t    mean what the Petitioners say they mean. Right?     30   So the three things we think competent   jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of   the New Deal of the \\'40s and early \\'50s was -- these was   these three things.   So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims. And that issue was resolved.   The second thing --    31   JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the court said   \"general jurisdiction,\" right?   MR. BROOKS: They -- they certainly did.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: \"General jurisdiction,\"   instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when   \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the   sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to   sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed   to the Court.   Does this Court have authority to proceed in   this category of cases?   MR. BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We now have three   versions, but that\\'s okay.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: I\\'m going to go with nine.   (Laughter.)    33   MR. BROOKS: But here\\'s what else we know.   The number of statutes that have the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" alone, based on some Lexis research very   early this morning, is 781. So if the phrase \"competent   jurisdiction\" together with \"State\" or \"Federal\" exists   only nine times, but \"competent jurisdiction\" as a   generic matter occurs 781 times, that\\'s the rule that we   urge on this Court today.   The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- I\\'m sorry.   MR. BROOKS: So Your Honor, I was going   to -- go ahead.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the   other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases   that are going to be added to the Federal docket.   Do you have an answer to that?   MR. BROOKS: I have many answers to that,   Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this.      The easiest answer is no --  34    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don\\'t tell us we\\'re not    working hard enough.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: I do recall, Justice Kennedy,    that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year.    Maybe foreclosures could be among them.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were easier cases.    MR. BROOKS: Perhaps I should sit down.    (Laughter.)    MR. BROOKS: Your Honor, the easiest answer    to that is that it\\'s undisputed in this case that    Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae    charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed    belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction. Freddie Mac has    almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has. There    has been no race to the Federal courthouse.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a specific    statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if    Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,    to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why    didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it    said --    MR. BROOKS: Well, so, Your Honor, we know a    couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie     35   Mac. But just let me make sure I\\'ve closed off on the   Chief Justice\\'s question, which is the fact that there\\'s   no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for   Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie   Mae, its sister organization.   Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress\\'s intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36    JUSTICE BREYER: I just want you to -- to    talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of    legislative history, which could not be more clear. It    says exactly what the government says. It says -- they    are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t    we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the    right to go into a Federal court, although the matter    may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?    MR. BROOKS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the --    JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you that --    what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t    look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say    that. What -- what should I do?    MR. BROOKS: Justice Breyer, two -- two      points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign.   JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.   (Laughter.)   MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,   or perhaps hope.   But in any case, 1938 was a different   statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that   wasn\\'t even created in 1938. The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that\\'s being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D\\'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D\\'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D\\'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D\\'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross.   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal    39   courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts   of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have   to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish   their right to be there.   Now, I think you have to do more than win   51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.   Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more   than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration   that we need to take into account.   MR. BROOKS: So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,   there\\'s no question that the courts are limited   jurisdiction courts, and we should look at   subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.   Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It\\'s about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That\\'s really all it\\'s   about. I don\\'t think there\\'s a serious question but   that under Article III -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there\\'s so many ways   that you could -- if you want to make sure that this   entity gets into Federal court all the time, what   Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will   be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and   removal purposes.   Now, that is very clear. It means it can    40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.   This, compared to \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent   jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the   Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and   personal.   MR. BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That\\'s because this    Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is    personal.    MR. BROOKS: Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: It shouldn\\'t matter to   the Federal court. They can be there if there is   diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true, Your Honor. That   exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised   specifically in Red Cross. It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.   And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not   being particularly relevant. Lots of companies remove   on lots of grounds all the time.   And by the way -  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Red Cross didn\\'t have   the competence language. It was just any court, State   or Federal.    44   MR. BROOKS: That\\'s true. But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn\\'t have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn\\'t matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn\\'t say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court.   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn\\'t they do   that for Fannie Mae?   MR. BROOKS: Because we -- I mean, it\\'s hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the \\'30s and \\'40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn\\'t have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan\\'s   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I\\'m trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we\\'d like to change Fannie Mae\\'s language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that\\'s only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I\\'d like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There\\'s no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction.   JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up? I   mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this   language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.    47   It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there   is a human being who wrote it.   MR. BROOKS: Yeah.   JUSTICE BREYER: But who? Where did he come   from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was fired.   JUSTICE BREYER: He was fired.   MR. BROOKS: It\\'s possible it was a former   staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope   not.   Your Honor, the -- here is what we know. We   know the language pre-existed. We know it wasn\\'t   created in nineteen -  JUSTICE BREYER: Are those words,   \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" -  MR. BROOKS: \"State or Federal.\"   JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"   You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who   did this.   MR. BROOKS: If I find them, I will let you   know.   Your Honor, here\\'s what we do know: We know   the language was not de novo in 1954. We know it was   written in the \\'30s for the Federal Housing    48   Administration. That\\'s what we know. That\\'s where the   phrase first came from. And we know that that language   had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress   had no indication it could have meant anything else. We   know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the   Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,   \"competent jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, conferred   jurisdiction.   Here\\'s what else we know: We know that in   briefing before this Court in the \\'80s, looking at this   exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing   Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition   to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth   Redevelopment case. And in that brief citing Ferguson,   the Solicitor General\\'s office said that phrase creates   jurisdiction in the district courts. Okay? That\\'s what   we know. That has always been the understanding.   And if we didn\\'t have that history and we   didn\\'t have that case law, we might write it differently   on a blank slate. But writing 200 years after Osborn   and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we   know what it means.   The disruption that would be created in the   markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower   courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to      the same result, at least three in the courts of  49    appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different    powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a    reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests    there was a reason for treating them differently, which    is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of    Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that    Fannie\\'s board, two-thirds of it does not.    MR. BROOKS: Right. But the Fannie board,    unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the    President of the United States until conservatorship in    2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury    access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC    registration exemptions. I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,    Congress has never treated one differently, not in the    \\'70s and not today. So there\\'s no plausible reason why    they would have wanted these treated differently.     50   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why they   have that different structure on the board of directors?   MR. BROOKS: Well, again, Your Honor, and   it\\'s interesting, I\\'ve actually personally spoken to   some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late   \\'60s, okay? They were all former government officials,   because Fannie was, in \\'68, being extricated from its   Federal agency role.   Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.   Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn\\'t. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That\\'s why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the \\'50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the \\'70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn\\'t justified by either history or policy or text.    If there are no further questions, thank    you.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes.        MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.    Just a couple of points.    First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What    do you do when the language points one way and the cases    seem to point another? I would -- I\\'d dispute the \"the    cases seem to point another,\" but my direct answer is:    This Court has never gone wrong by going with the    language, and in those previous cases, what the Court    was trying to do in each case was go with the language,    right down to Red Cross where the operative principle    was: What did this very language mean last time this    Court addressed it?    Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural     52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.   Fannie says it could mean personal   jurisdiction. It could mean -- it could mean venue. It   could mean general jurisdiction. Plug each of those   words into the statute, and it just doesn\\'t parse. But   the bottom line is you need to commit to what that   meaning is, and this Court can\\'t go wrong by   interpreting those words to mean what this Court has   said of competent jurisdiction.   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it means   personal jurisdiction. Why doesn\\'t it parse?   MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. So now the statute   says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has   personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or   Federal.   Well, the Federal Court of Claims has   personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a   grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is   that this now turns into a grant of Federal   subject-matter jurisdiction. It\\'s not a grant of   jurisdiction to Fannie.   So what about the court of appeals cases      that Mr. Brooks has addressed? Those cases did not  53    interpret the phrase of \"competent jurisdiction,\" and    they were not about Federal jurisdiction. Everyone    understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that    there was Federal jurisdiction. The question was    whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district    court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal    court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn\\'t that USG\\'s    position in Portsmouth?    MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\\'t    explain the position that the government has taken, but    the government has said that those were also kind of    drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply    did not involve the question of what is the source of    Federal jurisdiction.    If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They    were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting    Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.    So Congress said, we are not giving them any       advantage. But case after case has held that, of  54    course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just    one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have    held, before this case came along -- the vast majority    of cases have held that there was no automatic    jurisdiction for Fannie.    Thank you, Your Honors.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.    '"

A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction',\n",

       " '   MR. ROSENKRANZ:',\n",
       " ' I -- I am not limiting it   to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.   It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction. But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State',\n",

I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257    of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal    court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate    capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal    jurisdiction.\"    That seems to say if you authorize suit in    Federal court, then that\\'s it.

The rule is, and I   quote, \"A congressional charter\\'s sue-and-be-sued   provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,   but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal   courts.\"   So you need a mention of Federal courts in   order to even have a conversation about whether the   \"may\" is in play. But a reference to Federal courts is   not sufficient.   And so another way to think about it is,   sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,   State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without   more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction',\n",

There is a Federal    question under 1331. Show me where there is personal    jurisdiction. Okay. That\\'s where it gets a little bit    harder. Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.    And Fannie has never explained how you can    take the same language and map it out differently to    reach different results depending upon which word it    modifies and even different results when it modifies the    same word.    And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"',\n",

It   could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but   look to the venue provisions to figure out where the   suit is appropriately brought.   This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Every court that has ever evaluated this language has   concluded it\\'s a grant of diversity jurisdiction.   Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the   only basis being diversity jurisdiction.

And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply    concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going    private. It was now going to be in the mortgage market.    I did a search. There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is    involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in    State court.

We think there is a plausible story for why   Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued   clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if   you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying,   the text of the statute should control.   The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell   Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity   may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State   or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that   Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the   Federal courts.   In this case, the Court should give Congress   the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language   \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of        competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have   to look to some other provision of law to see if that   court is vested with jurisdiction',\n",

I'll give you an example that HUD has given    to me over time. HUD often likes to litigate these    cases in State court. These are mortgage foreclosure    cases. They are quintessential State court questions.    There can be a case -- and this happens    frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in    State court. HUD may also be named as a defendant if    HUD has an interest in the mortgage. HUD may want to    leave that case in the State court where the State    courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all    the time. They are all State law causes of action, just       as in this case.       If the Court were to say that the language    which is also in HUD's charter, that it can sue or be    sued in any State or Federal court of competent    jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter    over that suit, then the private party can now remove    the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the    resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the    borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.

It didn\\'t use   the language \"court of competent jurisdiction\" when it   referred to the Federal courts. It used that language   only with respect to the State courts.   D\\'Oench, Duhme did not use the language   \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" Justice Breyer.

You   cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a   Federal district court unless there is complete   diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in   controversy.

There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction',\n",

Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency.

Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28',\n",

Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right.

So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims.

First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has. We have nine total, including   Fannie Mae',\n",

The rule is, when combined with the grant of   jurisdiction embodied in the word \"Federal\" under Red   Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general   jurisdiction holdings of other cases. You have the   grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and   its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional   rule that is very clean.   Now -',\n",

Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36\",\n",

That\\'s not what we    intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you    know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a    State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.    I mean -- and the words \"competent    jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their    natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --    but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s    the point of having these here if the statute without    them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court    if you want?',\n",

       " ' Justice Breyer, two -- two      points.    37    So first of all, on the -- on the natural    reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of    \"competent jurisdiction\" standing alone is different    from the natural reading of \"competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal. And there is no case, I emphasize,    that holds those words together, don\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.   So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That   was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,   the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost   his re-election campaign',\n",

The congressional charter   for Fannie Mae that's being reviewed today was created   in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was   adopted, and six years after D'Oench, Duhme. And the   language adopted in 1948 was the D'Oench, Duhme   language.   So somebody has to prevail, either the   Supreme Court unanimously in D'Oench, Duhme, or the   failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is   most likely this Court in D'Oench, Duhme followed in Red   Cross\",\n",

Having said that, this fundamentally is a   case about statutory construction. It's about what did   Congress mean to do in 1954. That's really all it's   about.

Now, that is very clear. It means it can    40   come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove   if it\\'s sued in State court.

       " '.   MR. BROOKS:',\n",
       " ' So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera. And that\\'s what the case law    holds.    But the most --',\n",
       " '    JUSTICE GINSBURG:',\n",
       " \" That's because this    Court's competence is general competence, which is    subject matter, and it's specific competence, which is    personal\",\n",
       " '.    MR. BROOKS:',\n",
       " ' Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status',\n",

It was a point of discussion   in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that   Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.

But the point I   was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction   didn't have some negative implication for other sources,   and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful   evidence that that shouldn't matter.   Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and   suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued   in State or Federal court. It also says, Freddie -  Freddie doesn't say competent jurisdiction.   But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court\",\n",

       " '   MR. BROOKS:',\n",
       " \" Because we -- I mean, it's hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the '30s and '40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn't have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that's only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn't sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There's no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction\",\n",

I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter.

Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn't. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That's why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the '50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the '70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn't justified by either history or policy or text.

A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction'),\n",

And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court.

Make sure that the person is within the    confines of the Court.    But -- but I would also say just mapping,    again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the    statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this    clause that says, \"court of competent jurisdiction\"    State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction    to every Federal court either.    The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.

And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction.

Now, when Congress expressly provides that a   federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue   and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction   under D\\'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and   their prodigy.   Congress can obviously displace that rule if   it wants to. There are a lot of ways Congress can do   that. One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency.

Each of   those appellate decisions at that time, every one of   them, held that the full phrase \"court of competent   jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" conferred jurisdiction.   I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.   Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that   the language it was borrowing from another agency in the   same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would   restrict Fannie Mae\\'s access to Federal court, and that      history shows the distinction.  28'),\n",

Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.    And when counsel argues that the phrase    \"competent jurisdiction\" needs a separate source of    jurisdiction, they are right.

So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims.

       "  ' Yes, Your Honor. So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has.

Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36\"),\n",

But now, on the question about what was --    you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there    is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.    And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.

       "  ' So, Your Honor, let me begin   where you ended, if I might, and just say that this   Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase   \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,   has multiple different meanings depending on context.   In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this   Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter   jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal   jurisdiction citing cases.   In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.   Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before   our statute was decided, it said that in that context,   the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.   So I think the only way to harmonize all of   these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction   is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross   language/Osborn/D\\'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the   other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally      means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general  41    jurisdiction, et cetera.

       "  ' Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status'),\n",

But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes. It separately says Freddie shall have   statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the   limitations of 1442. So Freddie has four distinct   grounds for getting to Federal court\"),\n",

       " ('   MR. BROOKS:',\n",
       "  \" Because we -- I mean, it's hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the '30s and '40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn't have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that's only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn't sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There's no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction\"),\n",

I mean, Your Honor, there is    no material policy different between these two agencies,    and again, we have the legislative history that shows an    intent to treat these the same.    I will say that since 1974, every GSE    statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously    imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and    the Freddie Mac charter.

Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn't. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That's why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy.

Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is    simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn\\'t dispute    that our reading is a natural reading of the language.    Fannie doesn\\'t even dispute that it\\'s the most natural     52   reading. Instead, its entire argument revolves around   this proposition that it might actually mean other   things, but I still don\\'t know what Fannie thinks it   means.

If I may, one last point on Fannie and    Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them    differently? The answer is different era, 32 years    apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being    supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,    what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board.

       "  ' Mr. Chief Justice, and may it   please the Court:   I\\'d like to first to pick up on a point that   Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the   history of the statute and its amendment. I think the   statute in its current form is probably not the type of   provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the   whole thing in one fell swoop. But it\\'s important to   understand that the text of the -- the current provision   is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and   things that were done in 1980.   Congress enacted the original church plan   provision. Presumably, it had in mind particular plans   that were established and maintained by churches and it   covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to   light. Other types of plans were found not to be   covered by the administrative agency that Congress   evidently believed should be covered. And so when   Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work   within the existing framework. We\\'re not quite sure   why, but at least one plausible explanation would be   there were some church plans that had been found to be   covered under the old \"established and maintained by a        church\" language. Congress may have wanted to avoid any   possible inference that those plans were no longer   covered, and so it retained the original language, but   defined it to include something else.   And when Congress passed the -- the   provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i),   that refers to a plan established and maintained for its   employees includes a plan maintained by a principal   purpose organization, I -- I think it\\'s -- it\\'s helpful   to recognize that there are two different sorts of   definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts.   Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition,   it\\'s trying to clarify what the defined term really   means. And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to   strain to read the definition in a way that makes it   consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined   term. But sometimes Congress will enact a provision   that says something like the -- for purposes of this   statute, the term \"State\" includes the District of   Columbia and Puerto Rico. When Congress does that, it\\'s   not trying to explain what State really means; it\\'s   simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for   purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico   to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be   treated. And that\\'s really what Congress was doing in       the 1980 amendment.       When it defined the term \"plan established    and maintained by a church\" to include plans that    satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it    was not saying this is what a plan established and    maintained by a church really is. It was saying, for    purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption,    we want these to be treated the same'),\n",

And the reason why they were talking about   agencies are very closely related to churches, that was   not a -- it was not to say -- their view is Congress   wanted to allow fishing.

       "  \" So I'm just going to start with   the funding issue.   The one thing that's pellucid about C is   that the church does not have to fund C(i) plans because   the statute explicitly allows the maintaining   organization to fund it. And C(i) moves maintenance   outside the church, which means the church are   absolutely off the hook.    61   They also -- you know, they -- they raise   the dignity plan. The sponsoring congregations did   establish those plans, and the other side argues the   sponsoring congregations are not the church. And I   guess that's because they're not priests.   The other thing I would ask you to read is   the brief by the United Church of Christ and the   Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. They explain   that the centralization that an establishment   requirement would impose is anathema to their religious   beliefs. And it's the same reason that the maintenance   is. It's the continuum, establishment and maintenance.   Establishment turns on day one. And then day two,   throughout time immemorial, there being -- the other   side concedes you can maintain them. But the notion   that there is some umbrella church for -- for the Jews   and the Protestants is just -- it's fantastical that   could possibly establish these plans.   The other thing I wanted to mention, the   other side keeps talking about these closely-tied joint   plans. But the only other thing we know that is   pellucid about C is that an exempt plan can cover every   single employee in this country for a religious   non-profit institution and not a single church employee   needs to be in that plan.    62   The other side is asking you to engage in a   counterintuitive kind of weird thing that a church would   set the dental plans and vesting requirements for   employees of an affiliated organization, especially in a   place like the Jewish and Protestant religions. And   that -- that just is not credible.   And finally, on the anomalies. I mean, they   have the anomalies that the pension board would want to   divorce the establishment from the maintenance.

       " ('.      MR. STEWART:',\n",
       "  ' Mr. Chief Justice, and may it   please the Court:   I\\'d like to first to pick up on a point that   Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the   history of the statute and its amendment. I think the   statute in its current form is probably not the type of   provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the   whole thing in one fell swoop. But it\\'s important to   understand that the text of the -- the current provision   is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and   things that were done in 1980.   Congress enacted the original church plan   provision. Presumably, it had in mind particular plans   that were established and maintained by churches and it   covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to   light. Other types of plans were found not to be   covered by the administrative agency that Congress   evidently believed should be covered. And so when   Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work   within the existing framework. We\\'re not quite sure   why, but at least one plausible explanation would be   there were some church plans that had been found to be   covered under the old \"established and maintained by a        church\" language. Congress may have wanted to avoid any   possible inference that those plans were no longer   covered, and so it retained the original language, but   defined it to include something else.   And when Congress passed the -- the   provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i),   that refers to a plan established and maintained for its   employees includes a plan maintained by a principal   purpose organization, I -- I think it\\'s -- it\\'s helpful   to recognize that there are two different sorts of   definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts.   Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition,   it\\'s trying to clarify what the defined term really   means. And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to   strain to read the definition in a way that makes it   consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined   term. But sometimes Congress will enact a provision   that says something like the -- for purposes of this   statute, the term \"State\" includes the District of   Columbia and Puerto Rico. When Congress does that, it\\'s   not trying to explain what State really means; it\\'s   simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for   purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico   to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be   treated. And that\\'s really what Congress was doing in       the 1980 amendment.       When it defined the term \"plan established    and maintained by a church\" to include plans that    satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it    was not saying this is what a plan established and    maintained by a church really is. It was saying, for    purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption,    we want these to be treated the same'),\n",

Part -- part of that has to do with the    instinct that I -- I alluded to earlier. That is, we    would tend to regard a provision like that as one in    which Congress was really trying to explain what the    term \"person who is disabled and a veteran\" means, and    so we would strain to read the definition in a way that    made it consistent. If Congress passed a statute that    said something like: Person who is disabled and a    veteran shall include any Federal employee with 30 years    or more of service, at -- at that point, we would    understand Congress has just abandoned the effort to    explain what person who is disabled and a veteran    actually means.

We also mean to    include National Guard folks, and that's not    disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard    folks. But the two criteria are still the two criteria.    All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that    you are a National Guard. And you could read this    language similarly.

But I think, in construing this provision,    it may be helpful to look at page   of the government\\'s    brief which explains -- which kind of clarifies    something that Ms. Blatt was referring to earlier,    that -- that on page   of the -- the government\\'s        brief, we lay out the way in which this amendment       changed from the time it was first introduced in 1979 to    when it was enacted in 1980.    And as the questioning in the first part of    your argument explained, the original introduced    provision said a plan established and maintained by a    church shall include a plan established and maintained    by a principal-purpose organization. And so the -- the    words \"established and\" appeared two places in that    introduced provision. And as -- we agree with Ms. Blatt    that the most likely explanation for what -- why    Congress took out the -- the second \"established and\"    was that it was worried about plans that would fall    between two stools, a plan that was established by a    church, but maintained by a principal-purpose    organization.

Second, the whole point of the church plan   exemption is that plans that qualify will not be   regulated under ERISA at all. They will be regulated    27   under State law. So if a church, in order to satisfy   this requirement, established the plan and then left its   maintenance to somebody else, whether the church would   have any ongoing liability would depend on State laws   that might vary around the country.

And so   the courts have devised tests and approaches to   determine in particular cases who the proper defendant   is. And to some extent, that will depend upon the way   the plan itself is constructed; that is, the plan may   say that the responsibility for doing certain things is   that of the employer, for doing other things, it may be   that of the insurer. And so the proper defendant may   determine on where responsibility is allocated under the       terms of the plan.  28    And -- but so I agree that one big    difference between this case and the hypotheticals is    the -- the hypothetical is constructed in a way that    suggests disability has to be crucial to entitlement to    benefits, whereas here, there's no reason to think that    Congress, in 1980, regarded church establishment as    crucial to the exemption.

That's what the original statute said,   but only until 1982. And that is what everybody was   objecting to, and that's why people was -- people were   objecting to the withdrawal of that sunset provision   that was going to happen in 1982.   And the reason why they were talking about   agencies are very closely related to churches, that was   not a -- it was not to say -- their view is Congress   wanted to allow fishing.

They didn't analyze what would -  inevitably did happen, which is there are six or seven   church plans already that have failed and left the   employees with nothing; but had they been covered by   ERISA, they would have had PBGC insurance. The IRS   didn't take any of that into account at all. And to -  you know, they were just wrong in 1982.   And in fact, it's hard to -- it's clear in   one part that they're wrong that we talk about in the   brief.

I would like to make one other point on -  on reliance, which is, you know, this is about bringing    60   these plans into compliance with ERISA. That shouldn't   be a hard thing to do, and a district court should be   able to do it, giving them whatever period of time is   reasonable. That's the overwhelming thing that's at   issue here. And in fact, if, as they say, they haven't   departed from ERISA that much, which we don't agree or   believe, then it should be particularly easy to bring   them into compliance with ERISA.

The one thing that's pellucid about C is   that the church does not have to fund C(i) plans because   the statute explicitly allows the maintaining   organization to fund it. And C(i) moves maintenance   outside the church, which means the church are   absolutely off the hook.    61   They also -- you know, they -- they raise   the dignity plan. The sponsoring congregations did   establish those plans, and the other side argues the   sponsoring congregations are not the church. And I   guess that's because they're not priests.   The other thing I would ask you to read is   the brief by the United Church of Christ and the   Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. They explain   that the centralization that an establishment   requirement would impose is anathema to their religious   beliefs. And it's the same reason that the maintenance   is. It's the continuum, establishment and maintenance.   Establishment turns on day one. And then day two,   throughout time immemorial, there being -- the other   side concedes you can maintain them. But the notion   that there is some umbrella church for -- for the Jews   and the Protestants is just -- it's fantastical that   could possibly establish these plans.   The other thing I wanted to mention, the   other side keeps talking about these closely-tied joint   plans. But the only other thing we know that is   pellucid about C is that an exempt plan can cover every   single employee in this country for a religious   non-profit institution and not a single church employee   needs to be in that plan.    62   The other side is asking you to engage in a   counterintuitive kind of weird thing that a church would   set the dental plans and vesting requirements for   employees of an affiliated organization, especially in a   place like the Jewish and Protestant religions. And   that -- that just is not credible.   And finally, on the anomalies. I mean, they   have the anomalies that the pension board would want to   divorce the establishment from the maintenance.

A \"court of competent   jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source   of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court   has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start   with the plain language.   The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The   power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any   \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\"   The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to   say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any   State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,   State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent   jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a   court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to        examine the statutes creating that court and granting it   jurisdiction',\n",

But no, a   court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has   subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has   personal jurisdiction.   And the -- the cases that my friends rely   upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are   cases in which there was already subject-matter   jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a   minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter   jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those   cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction.   Now, five times this Court has interpreted   the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote,   \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional   authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone;   this Court held that any reference to competent      jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to       competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it    unquestionably meant that the competency of the court    should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in    respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not    map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.    Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would    require the Court to read the phrase \"competent    jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon    which word modifies it.    So Fannie concedes that the clause referring    to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be    read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court. A    State court can\\'t take jurisdiction unless you point to    a statutory authority for the State',\n",

The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.    The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent    jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements    are otherwise satisfied.

And the statutory evolution also confirms    this. It unfolded in three critical steps.    Step   was the original enactment. It was         before D\\'Oench. And Congress chose language that, per   Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not   grant jurisdiction.   Step   was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been   decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite   of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember,   there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and   then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to   match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision   that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took   a right turn and added the words \"competent   jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for   example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on   other provisions of law.\"   Step   was 1974. After the shift to private   entity was consummated, Congress further amended the   charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity   jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal   jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no   longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction   in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose   for diversity jurisdiction. So Congress changed   Fannie\\'s charter to say that it is a District of   Columbia corporation, quote, \"for purposes of   jurisdiction and venue.\"',\n",

There\\'s a few other textual points that I   think reinforce the point we are trying to make. One is   that Section 1349 should be an important point of   reference. Congress established a general rule that   having a government charter is not enough to confer   Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United   States owns 50 percent of the corporation\\'s stock, and   when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie   Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication   from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter   jurisdiction',\n",

One way would be to eliminate the word \"Federal,\"   as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that   rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency.

I\\'m talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans   case, and the Seven Oaks case.

Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance    Corporation, they changed their language in the \\'54    statute to remove the word \"Federal.\" We think the    reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that    time, was truly a Federal agency.    Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,    was transitioning into a new structure, right? There    would eventually be private ownership. And the idea    here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what    the Petitioners mean here. They wanted to adopt the FHA    language, the language that had been interpreted in the    \\'40s, and, again, at the time of the \\'54 Act there had    been no case which had held that language didn\\'t confer    jurisdiction.    Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this       Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29    jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand    about those cases is the number of those five cases that    interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the    phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not    Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked    at the two phrases together.

So the first thing was, there was a very   vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature   of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they   were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard   in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard   generally in the district courts. This was the precise   question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,   that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in   briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under   these exact same words. That was the SG\\'s briefing in   the Portsmouth case. Okay?   But what \"competent jurisdiction\" in this   context was held to mean at that time was the direction   that general jurisdiction courts, and not only   specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.   The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the   time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,   later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State   court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of   Claims.

So the way we   think all these things work together is, first of all,   as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent   jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously   held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?   Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no   cases to the contrary at the time.   And the understanding of what \"competent   jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,   from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s   fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because   the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of   Federal housing policy having very little to do with   jurisdiction.    32   And we think what happened is they simply   borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to   confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.   There was no other reason to think they meant anything   different from that.   But we also know that less than two years   before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this   Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a   standalone basis and said that all it referred to at   that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.   That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent   jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means   is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it   means personal jurisdiction courts of general   jurisdiction.   Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the   question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued   clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor,   that your clerk has.

Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about   Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know   is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative   history in both the House Report and the Senate Report   make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to   create an entity that had identical powers that would   develop in parallel and that would have no advantage   over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in   drafting it.   Now, the words were unquestionably   different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter   were different from the words in the Second Bank of the   United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.   The reason the words were different at the   time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of   writing in a blank slate. So Congress sat down, without   60 years of history, without the need to extricate a   legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization   scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit   down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look     like.    36\",\n",

And that respect is if the colloquy related to the    statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it    clearer.    But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that    counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that    created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more    probative than if it had been the legislative history of    an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?    In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress    authorized the creation of entirely different private    mortgage associations which never came into being. The    sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was    that private capital would come into the market pursuant    to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the     38   legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and   Chicago, and New York, and would start creating   liquidity to solve the problem.

       "  ' Correct. That\\'s exactly right.    And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'    intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to    understand is when Congress borrowed this language that    had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration    for   years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its    verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that    language had held it was sufficient to confer    subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the    Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six    years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that    those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in    any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry    on which Congress was weaving at the time.    Now, let me address, if I might just    briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and    the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking       about this privatization concept and how it would be  42    that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress    was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private    company and deprive it of special access to the Federal    courts.    The presumption behind that argument is    that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately    owned company to have special access, except we know    from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that    there are times when a privately owned company is    sufficiently important, it can have special access. The    Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private    shareholders.    Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know    that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at    its inception with clear and undisputed access to the    Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of    course, because it was writing in a different era and    writing on a different slate without all the baggage    that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no    question that privately owned instrumentalities when    pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can    qualify under these circumstances.    But the other problem with their theory if    it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails     43   in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not   privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even   when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954   Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it   still had special access to the Federal courts under   1345.   So if there had been a conscious legislative   judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at   that time, they surely would have had to do the work of   taking away its agency status',\n",

But what else Freddie says is Freddie says   that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345   purposes.

       "  \" Because we -- I mean, it's hard   to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of   the Framers of our charter. But the original charter   language was written in the '30s and '40s. It was   written at a time when we were connected with multiple   other agencies. We were part of the Department of   Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became   Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do    45   essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this   big accretion of language over decades.   Freddie Mac didn't have that problem. So   Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting   from scratch.   I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's   colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would   happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.   And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor   Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.   We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language. We   want to add this competent jurisdiction language.   Now, that's only been looked at three times   before, and all of those cases said that confers   jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or   perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a   way of removing jurisdiction.   That doesn't sound plausible any more in   this case than it did in the prior case to me, given   what the case law backdrop was of the time.   Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point   about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you   know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac   has different language. The question is, is this a good   thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?    46   Our view basically is Congress said what it   meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said   that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were   supposed to have no advantages over each other and have   all the same powers.   The question for this Court is: Why would   Congress -- although it used a different language across   multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac   to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same   securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC   exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,   but have different Federal court litigating powers?   There's no answer to that.   And all we know is that in terms of the   Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what   we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only   much, much bigger. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to   imagine that a $  trillion dollar company, the largest   company in the United States by assets, creating housing   across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been   intended not to be protected by Federal court   jurisdiction\",\n",

Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of   1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn't. Fannie   Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be   torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That's why the original   board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of   Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD   Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general   counsel of HUD. They were all Federal officials at that   time, and it took multiple years before they could be   extricated. There is just a history here, which makes   it different.   But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the   largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.   economy. Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers   and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because   the language of the '50s and a complicated history      differed a little bit from the language of the '70s,  51    would be a significant policy shift that we would argue    isn't justified by either history or policy or text.

We think that's clearly right when you look at   (f)( ) and (f)( ) together, especially in light of   extraterritoriality concerns.

And the way we had put it is   that it reaches the supply of all or something   tantamount to all of the components.   And our principal practical concerns here   stem from the breadth of the Federal Circuit's ruling,   and it's broad because they are asking a loaded question   that's looking only at part of the picture.   If you look only at the supplied portion of   the components and you ask whether they are important or   essential to the operation or novelty of the invention,   the answer is always going to be yes. In most   inventions, if you take away any component, it isn't   going to work and it's not going to be patentable. So   we think you just can't come at it that way.   And then the second piece is that the   Federal Circuit isn't looking at all the components that   were not supplied, and so they are not asking the   comparative question of whether the person has done   anything similar to supplying all of the components.        And we think that's just a critical piece here. This is   an anti-circumvention provision.

When the    Deepsouth solution was proposed by Senator Mathias, it    precluded the supply with no active inducement    requirement, the supply of the material components of a    combination that if combined in the United States would    infringe.    In the 1984 hearing that\\'s discussed at page    29 of our brief, the United States -- the commissioner     30   of patents came in and testified that the United States   objected to that interpretation. They objected to the   topdown -- you know, not -- not totally all, and   proposed instead that Senator Mathias amend his   legislation to preclude what in essence is prohibited   domestically in 271(c); that is, contributory   infringement. That is the supply of a single, specially   designed part where there are no substantial   non-infringing uses.   That in and of itself shows you how far -  and that is, in fact, 271(f)( ). And that shows you how   far from this \"all or substantially all\" paradigm   Congress was aiming.   Now, Senator Mathias\\'s response right   there -- and again, we discuss it at page 29 -- was,   okay, I understand that. But what about, he said, the   situation of the, quote, exporter who sends specific   instructions on how to manufacture a product which would   infringe a U.S. patent notwithstanding the use of a   staple product or products?   And Commissioner Mossinghoff\\'s response was,   gee, I hadn\\'t thought of that. That would be the analog   to 271(b). That is the induced infringement requirement   which makes one liable as an infringer if you actively   induce infringement by another and --    31',\n",

As this Court explained in Microsoft   v. AT&T, the use of the word \"components\" is the -- is   Congress\\'s indication that the combinations that are   precluded are tangible or physical combinations, not   method patents or unembodied software. That\\'s how you       know what the scope of the combination is.  34    And if Congress had said, you know, to    export one or more rather than a substantial portion,    you would still use the plural because the plural is    necessary to accommodate the instance in which it will,    in fact, commonly be more than one.    Now, in your hypothetical, if you\\'re talking    about a substantial portion of units that are    indistinguishable from each other, like pages of the    brief, then I concede that the more natural reading is a    quantitative one. But if you look at how \"substantial\"    is used in the relevant provisions, the provisions of    the patent code that my friend on the other side is    averting to, that is (f)( ), where substantial    non-infringing uses is plainly at least partly    qualitative, or, as they say, the Warner-Jenkinson, the    doctrine of equivalence case where equivalency turns on    substantiality of functions and methods and uses, it is    also qualitative, our argument is that, again, we agree    with the United States whether the extent to which    substantial is qualitative or quantitative depends on    the context.    And so my only point, Mr. Chief Justice,    just so that I\\'m not misunderstood here, is Congress --    when Congress, rather than what it started to do, which     35   was to count down -- enact something that counted down   from all the components, it instead scrapped it at the   United States\\' suggestion and started from the ground up   from contributory infringement, which is just one   component specially designed, and active inducement,   which doesn\\'t require the supply of any components.   Now, in this instance, and this goes, I   think, to Justice Breyer\\'s question about   extraterritoriality, Congress was very careful -- of   course, as this Court recognized in Microsoft, there are   extraterritorial implications because it concerns   exporting things for something to be done in commerce   overseas. But Congress was very, very careful to make   the conduct that the provision looks at domestic only.   It is -- you have to actively induce from the United   States an active inducement, this Court explained in the   Grokster case means active steps to encourage like   advertising or providing instructions.

Justice    Thomas explained for the Court that that was a case that    involved the patent exhaustion doctrine where Intel was    supplying a very sophisticated microchip, microprocessor    that was used by Quanta Computer in a computer that had,    you know, gazillion other components.    And the question was whether Intel's sale of    the microprocessor to LGE, which then sold it to Quanta,        exhausted the patent. And what this Court said is,  40    well, it didn't exhaust the patent on the combination,    because, obviously, it's only one or two components.    But because that microchip -- that    microprocessor embodied the -- what it said was the    inventive aspect of the computer as a whole, we are    going to take account of that and hold that patent    exhaustion applies. And that would apply not only to my    pharmaceutical example or Justice Alito's, you know, one    super important component, it would apply to a more --    you know, the Quanta example where there may be -- say    there are   components, but three of them constitute    the inventive aspect.    This -- the language is capacious enough and    can be read in a commonsense way to make clear that that    is what Congress intended to address in (f)( ) by    enacting -- provided there is active encouragement for    the combination, by enacting the analog, the -- the (f)    analog to what is active inducement under (b)\",\n",

There was a -- there was a   concession at trial that both primers and the Taq   polymerase were supplied for almost half of the kits.

And I understand that, and that's certainly a  53    significant protection.    But Congress did not take 271(b) and (c) and    simply apply them in the (f)( ) context or the (f)( )    context. What it said is, there has to be a substantial    portion, all or a substantial portion.

I think the answer is, it cannot be under those    circumstances.    Justice Kennedy, you asked the question    about, you know, what are we supposed to do in these    circumstances as -- you know, with supply chains? And    the answer is -- you know, the answer that my colleague    gave you was one that basically says, this is a recipe    for the trolls of the world to go and chase down every    supply opportunity. And do what? Send them notice that    what you're sending is a staple article that's a major     54   component of a piece that's in the patent, and that if   you send -- keep sending that, you're going to violate   that patent and we're going to come after you.   And what's that going to do? That's going   to disrupt the supply chain in the United States, and   the ultimate effect is going to be twofold: Either   purchasers outside the U.S. will stop purchasing from   inside the U.S., or U.S. manufacturers will go offshore.   And the one thing we know that 271(f) was never intended   to do was to accomplish that kind of an -- that kind of   an impact -- negative impact on the U.S. economy.

And to begin, I think   it's essential to note we are not disputing at any point   in this litigation that misstatements made that result   in a finding of probable cause at a Gerstein hearing is   a Fourth Amendment violation, nor does the Seventh   Circuit disagree.   The reason this came up to the Seventh   Circuit as it did -- and this may be important in   understanding the context -- this is on a motion to   dismiss for statute -- for violation of the statue of   limitations. All of the claims were dismissed but one,   the one that was appealed, and that one survived   momentarily in the district court because Petitioner   claimed that that one claim has a favorable termination   element because it is malicious prosecution.   He reiterated that claim before the Seventh   Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit reached two   conclusions.   One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which   they discuss, and that the only claim before them was    29   based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing. You have a   Fourth Amendment claim, but it is already accrued; it   accrued too early; it is untimely.   Now you're asking us to recognize a   different breed of Fourth Amendment claim, namely, a   malicious prosecution Fourth Amendment claim, because   you'd like to overcome the time bar.

The first time it says,   when after the arrest a particular person is not let go   when he should be -- so it\\'s after the initial seizure,   and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment   gives way to the due process clause as a basis for   challenging his detention.   And then in the last paragraph it says,   \"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention   by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out   of the picture.\"   So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh      Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth  30    Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and    after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the    picture.    And at the very basic level, before you get    into these questions of what\\'s the accrual date or    anything else, it seems that that\\'s the thing that the    Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment    claim continues after arraignment or after legal    process.

Now, the question of whether or not    malicious prosecution is the proper analogy, the answer    is absolutely not, and Wallace tells us why not.    Wallace tells us -- now, the Petitioner has shifted just    slightly from a reliance on common law favorable    termination, which is what most of the circuits on their    side of the split have done. This also goes, I think,    to Your Honor's question and to your point.    Most of the circuits on the other side of    the split have used favorable termination, but they've    done so by adopting it as part of the underlying    four-element common law tort, and they think if that's    what we're calling it, then it's going to have favorable    termination.    A smaller number have relied on an    extension, a drastic extension, of this Court's decision    in Heck. And that's the request now made by the    Petitioner in the reply brief, that Heck ought to be    expanded to apply here.     35   But Wallace was very clear. Heck only   applies -- the delayed accrual principle and the   favorable termination element that comes with it apply   only where you have an extant conviction. And that   doesn't exist here.   The court went through a mental exercise.   They said, look, if you can realize that you have a   Fourth Amendment claim before you're convicted, if the   elements can be in mind, you know you've been wronged in   a Fourth Amendment way before you are convicted, then   that is not a claim that is entitled to the delayed   accrual principle of Heck.   And the reason was very simple. Because as   this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment   contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good   convictions. And nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment   protects the innocent as well as the guilty. And   expanding Heck to apply the circumstance where all you   have is an ex parte requirement, or finding rather, of   probable cause, requiring that civil plaintiff to then   prove vindication at the end of the day would close the   door on a potential universe of Fourth Amendment claims   and instances\",\n",

       "  \" Well, Your Honor, just to make   sure that I've been clear, again, we do agree that the   lie -- the second lie Your Honor has described, the lie   before the magistrate, is actionable under the Fourth   Amendment. If the question is why then doesn't the   accrual period run from when one is ultimately released,   I would make a couple of points in response to Your   Honor's question.   First, Petitioner has been very careful not   to make that argument. Indeed, the continuing seizure   idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert   petition, which claimed they need the benefit of   favorable termination to prevail. They, of course,   wouldn't need it if they were instead arguing for a   period of a continuing seizure.   Lower courts have rejected the notion of a   continuing seizure, and they're not raising it here.   And I think the reason may be twofold.    37   The first is that it runs into -- it runs in   the face of traditional accrual principles that this   Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it's   not the period of harm that matters for accrual   purposes. It's when one first experiences the harm and   thereby has all the elements needed to proceed.   And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile   work environment case, is really the exception that   proves the rule. In many ways it tells us why or how   narrowly the Court has -- has construed the exceptions   to this typical accrual principle. Hostile work   environment does require precisely what Your Honor   describes because it's impossible to know precisely when   a hostile work environment begins. Is it the second   comment or the fifth or the tenth that someone has to   endure in the workplace, and therefore, the Court is   willing to consider it as a monolithic whole and treat   it that way for accrual purposes.   But again, that's the exception that proves   the rule. As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a   cutoff, which Wallace imposed between the initial arrest   and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that   regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a   continuing seizure.   The final point I would make -- and I think    38   this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely,   the brief by Professor Alschuler -- taken to its logical   conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one   to conclude that the seizure doesn't end until the   ultimate period of incarceration concludes. And what   that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs   bringing claims  ,  ,   years down the road without   any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability   to maintain evidence and so forth\",\n",

There may well be interrupting    39   events, but that I just want to make clear. We're not   suggesting that those damages may not be available, in   this case, had the claim been brought timely for the   full 48 days, depending on how those common law   proximate cause principles would shake out.   The other point -- and this is one that the   States made in their amicus brief in Wallace. They've   made it again as have the municipalities as amici.   They've made the point that early notice to the State as   employer of agents who are engaged in bad acts is   extraordinarily important. Government is intent upon   learning sooner rather than later that they have   individuals in their ranks that are violating the   Constitution.   And this Court in Wallace, in turning aside   basically the same extension of Heck that is recommended   for the Court, or the Court's invited to take in this   very case, when they turned it away, they said one of   the reasons is we need notice to the would-be defendants   in those cases.

I'd like to just turn for a moment as to why    we feel our -- our position makes sense, because we    framed our second argument in our brief as ensuring the    purpose of the veteran keep all of his disability pay,    both in form and in substance.    I think it makes sense that Congress would    have wanted veterans to keep all their disability pay    for the obvious reason that it's the veteran who's    disabled. And the point of the disability pay is to    substitute for income that the veteran can't earn    because of his or her disability. That's how it's    defined. You get a disability rating if you have a    reduced income potential. And so I think that this --    it makes perfect sense. I think everyone agrees that    the veteran should keep the disability pay.         The reason this dispute has come up is that   Congress has made this decision to cut a veteran's   pension or to force a veteran to waive a portion of his   own pension, which has already been earned, if he also   becomes disabled and accepts the disability pay. And   that's a pretty harsh judgment that Congress made,   essentially, to protect the public fisc, but that's what   Congress did.   So I think that what the statute is doing is   saying if the veteran is forced to do that, then the   veteran and the ex-spouse will both have their amounts   reduced by an equal amount; in other words, what's   divisible is just going to be the residual share. So I   think that's what this statute is doing.   And then if you frame it that way, I think   it makes perfect sense to treat the pre-divorce scenario   and the post-divorce scenario as parallel. Because I   don't think that the goal of protecting disability pay   really has anything to do with the timing of the   disability relative to the divorce. In other words, if   you have two disabled veterans and they're both   divorced, I think that their interest in keeping their   disability pay is the same, even if one of them happened   to become disabled the year before his divorce and the   other one happened to become disabled the year        afterwards. So I think that, you know, framed in those   terms, I think the -- the purpose of arguments don't   distinguish between the pre-divorce and the post-divorce   scenario\",\n",

       "  \" Mr. Chief Justice, and may it    please the Court:    The authority granted to the States by the    Former Spouses Protection Act to treat -- to treat    marital -- to treat Military Retirement Pay as property    and divide it necessarily operates at the time of the    divorce. The text of the Act, its primary purpose to         protect the former spouse, and the practical realities   of divorce make the time of divorce paramount. That is   when family courts must determine the extent of all of   the marital property, divide that property, and also   coordinate the multiple moving parts of a divorce, which   include spousal maintenance, which is often intertwined   with the division of property.   Now, the authority to divide Military   Retirement Pay is limited only by the Act's exclusion of   amounts of retirement pay that are then being deducted   as the result of a previous waiver to receive disability   benefits. And whether that division at the time of   divorce occurs before the member's retirement, as the   statute expressly allows, and, therefore, before any   waiver has occurred, or the division occurs after   retirement, the State law consequences of the property   division must follow along.   And those consequences can include the fact   that the -- in -- in a particular State that the   retirement pay awarded to a spouse is considered to be   that spouse's vested property. And also, the   consequential right of the State to formulate remedies   to protect and affect that property right, to compensate   for any damage that might be done to that property   interest.        And another consequence I -- that I think   has come up here today is -- is that of the finality of   the divorce decree and whether the State court has the   ability to go back and modify -- after a waiver of   retirement pay in favor of disability pay, to go back   and modify a division of property.

You know, one of the objectives of family   law courts is to achieve finality and -- and not have   folks coming back in the future. Certainly, child        support and spousal maintenance can be exceptions, but   there has to be a substantial and continuing change of   circumstances in order to justify revisiting, reopening,   modifying child support or spousal maintenance.   But property division is -- is thought to be   set in stone. At the time of divorce, the -- the   spouses are splitting the sheets and the Court must   determine how many sheets there are and how big they are   and decide who gets what. And what that is -- what is   decided at that point in time is what they have going   forward.

It does not   preempt State law. It does not effectively divide   disability benefits. And to a point raised by my   colleague, the order is -- is not one that modified the   decree at all. It was an enforcement order.   Now, I know you might say that the Arizona   Supreme Court characterized it as a modification. The   court did so for a different reason. It was deciding   whether a State statute regarding modification applied.   It determined that it did not, but it first determined   that there was a modification because there was no   indemnification provision in the decree.   But for purposes of this Act, a modified   decree is defined in the definitions as a -- a court   order that affects a division of property. There was no   division of property affected by the indemnification   order. It was, instead, in the nature of an   enforcement. In fact, the Arizona Supreme Court at   least twice refers to it as a reimbursement order or an   indemnification order or a make-up payment. It was    34   enforcing. It never changed anything in the original   divorce decree. So it was not a modification for   purposes of the Act.   What should the rule be?

And we're not -- our   position is not trying to alter, sort of, ordinarily   applicable rules of res judicata.   But the question in this case is finality as   to what. And we have an answer from the Arizona Supreme   Court. The court interpreted the decree to say that   what it did was it divided Petitioner's pension,   whatever it was. And that is a ruling that I think we   have to accept as this case reaches the Court; that's a   state law interpretation which binds this Court.   And so what the court held, however, is that   it was not going to enforce the decree as written. It   was going to import a State law rule that basically says   that the relevant divisible asset was the total amount   of the retirement pay and divide that.   I think the court is quite clear. It's   saying that it conceptualizes the property interests as   the total amount of money that Petitioner was receiving,   and it said that by waiving retirement pay, the   Petitioner converted a portion of respondent's property.   And so it's saying that Respondent holds a property    47   interest in half of that waived amount. So that's just   the same thing as treating waived retirement pay as   divisible. And so -\",\n",

And if the veteran doesn't agree, then   they'll just go to divorce court and there'll be a   decree where the court, we would say, would have to just   divide the retirement pay as mandated by Congress.   Now, we agree that settlements are good.   And there have been many reported cases where the    48   veteran says, look, I'll -- I'll make you this promise   if you agree to give me, you know, the car or whatever.   So we're not -- we're not reading this statute as   impinging on settlements.   But in this case, the court held that what   the settlement was, was just dividing the pension   whatever it was 50-50. The fact that Petitioner is   required to pay this reimbursement order, it's not what   he had agreed to; it's this order imposed by State law   saying that it was going to treat Respondent as holding   a property interest in half of the amount of the waived   retirement pay, which we think is -- is what the Federal   statute prohibits.   And in response to Justice Sotomayor's   question earlier, yes, I think that the reasonable   expectation is that the waivers might occur. I think   it's important to recognize that waivers of retirement   pay for disability are not rare or obscure. There's   hundreds of thousands of veterans who have done just   that. And I don't think it's a tremendous shock to an   experienced divorce lawyer that this might happen. And   so during negotiations for a divorce settlement, this   may come up. So I just think the idea that, you know,   there's no way to predict this could conceivably happen,   I think, is just inconsistent with the reality of -- of       divorce litigation in military divorces.  49    I'd like to respond to the -- the comments    of -- of counsel about other assets, that it's perfectly    fine to divide the accrual of disability pay as long as    there are just other assets used to fund it.    So first of all, I think that's quite    contrary to this Court's decision in Hillman and several    other cases. I think it's both counterintuitive, and I    think that the holding of those cases is that you can't    do that, because just the four corners of the -- the    Hillman holding was that, you know, Federal law preempts    a statute that doesn't directly act on property, but    just has property go into a bank account and then is    transferred to the other bank account, which is    essentially the same situation as here.    And I think it's also quite pertinent that    what the statute says is that it's division of waived    retirement pay that's impermissible. And recall that    waived retirement pay literally is not money you're    getting. The definition of waived retirement pay    literally is the money that you're not getting so you    can get disability pay. So when we talk about dividing    waived retirement pay, what just that inherently means    is forcing you to pay an amount from your general assets    equal to that waived retirement pay to the other spouse.        So I just think that, you know, it's not even just  50    legalistic. I just think the statute cannot be    construed to permit operation on the general assets.    And I just want to make one other point.    And, you know, Justice Sotomayor asked questions earlier    about sort of the policy distinctions between pre- and    post-divorce waivers. And we're not denying that    there's no policy distinctions at all. I mean, we can't    deny that. Of course there are differences in policy.    And I think that the interest of the disabled veteran is    the same before and after. But there are policy    distinctions at stake.    I think the question in this case is whether    this statute can be interpreted to recognize that those    policy distinctions and distinguished between those two    scenarios, and I just don't think you can't get it out    of the statutory text, which does prohibit waived    retirement pay from being treated as divisible no matter    when the waiver occurs.    If the Court has no further questions, I'll    rest. Thank you\",\n",

       "  \" Yes. Now, the -- as -- as my    friend on the other side pointed out, the notion that     38   there is going to be round   litigation very early in   any event is unlikely for the following reasons.   Number one, as they've reported, it takes   about   years, even for a biosimilar, to get developed.   And, you know, Amgen is both a reference product maker   and a biosimilar maker, and that's, in fact, consistent   with our experience. So the notion that there's going   to be, you know, an application filed in year   or year     or year   is unlikely.   Another reason that it's unlikely is   these -- these biosimilars -- you know, up until very,   very recent advances in gene sequencing, biosimilars   were -- the way they were defined was by the process   under which they were made. You take a particular cell   line and then you do the following   things at this   atmospheric pressure.   And the FDA will not approve a biosimilar   until it has inspected the manufacturing process and   facilities, which, according to the record, take -- is   about 100 or $200 million. And the notion that a   biosimilar is going to create a whole factory for the   FDA to review and then leave it open for -- until year     is quite unlikely.   The -- the issue here, even if the FDA took   the position that, nope, even though the statute only    39   says that approval can't be made effective, we're not   even going to tip our hand until   years is over, it   still wouldn't defeat the manifest purpose of the   statute.   This statute, like the Hatch-Waxman Act, has   two relevant periods. There is a period of data   exclusivity that is the period in which a competitor   can't use the sponsor's data. That's not a period of   market exclusivity. In fact, there is a competitor to   the product at issue in this case that's been on the   market for five years because Teva went through the   regular 271(A) process. So we have, as in Hatch-Waxman,   a period in which there's data exclusivity. And we then   have a period, just like in Hatch-Waxman -- there it's   30 months, here it's 180 days -- for the adjudication of   any patent disputes.   Now, my friends on the other side say, well,   this is different because in the Hatch-Waxman context,   the FDA actually approves, and then the 30-month period   for patent litigation occurs, whereas here, the FDA's   approval leaves aside the question of when they can or   can't approve it. If they don't approve it until   sometime after the   years has run, there's an   additional 180 days.   We don't know that because this has never       happened. But even if it did, the reason why  40    Congress -- the reason why you have to have FDA -- the    FDA say what's being approved, whereas in Hatch-Waxman    you don't, is in Hatch-Waxman we are talking about a    small molecule that has to be identical. It's made by    chemical synthesis, so there's no question.    When -- when a generic asks for Hatch-Waxman    approval, we know precisely what the molecule is. We    know precisely for what therapeutic purposes it will be    used because it has to be identical, and no one cares    what the manufacturing process is because this is simply    chemical synthesis of an identical molecule.    Whereas -- and this goes to Justice Breyer's    question about notice -- until the FDA decides what it    is, what is the compound that it is going to    authorize -- which, by definition, won't be identical --    and until it decides for what therapeutic purposes that    will be used, and until it specifies what the    manufacturing process in what location will be approved,    you can't give notice of anything.    And, if -- in fact, if you look again, we're    on the 180-day notice provision, subsection (a) of    262(l)( ), which -- I'm sorry, I'm looking at my own    appendix, but it's on page 31A of -- of my appendix.    The -- ( )(a) says the Notice of Commercial Marketing.     41   Subsection (b), entitled Preliminary Injunction, tells   you the most important consequence of ( )(a) -- and this   does go again, I think, Justice Sotomayor, with respect   to your question about how soon this can be done -- that   ( )(a) notice, first and foremost, allows the sponsor,   for the very first time, to seek a preliminary   injunction against the commercial marketing of the   product for the uses using the processes.   And you cannot go to a Federal district   court and ask for a preliminary injunction until you   know, A, that there's an imminency that occurs. You   can't go years in advance. B, you have to know what it   is that you are seeking to enjoin. This notion that   there's some artificial act of infringement that relates   to whatever you may or may not know is in the original   application for Article III purposes is irrelevant.   I mean, once the FDA -- the -- the question   is can you get an injunction against what is approved   for what purposes using what processes.

Now, what ( )(A) says is notwithstanding    those background rules, if the biosimilar applicant    chooses the (k) route and provides the application and    the manufacturing information, we're making an exception    to the general availability of declaratory judgments.    No one can file a declaratory-judgment action until the    notice of commercial marketing is given.

The -- the   Federal Circuit issued a Federal injunction and   dismissed their State law claims.   Two, the -- the statute -- Congress, when it   wanted to provide for an injunctive relief of the (l)   procedures, it did so. It provided for it in only one    61   instance: Violations of the confidentiality provisions   in (l)( )(H). And significantly, that\\'s also the only   provision that Congress called a failure to do something   in (l)( ) a violation. Yet, Amgen wants you to read the   statute and to read those -- the rest of these   provisions as implicitly entitling them to an injunction   that Congress chose not to provide, and instead they   want to call the remedies Congress did provide as the   backup. I -- that\\'s a very odd way to read the statute.   The rights here are patent rights. The   remedies they were given were patent remedies, and they   are forceful. They gave them artificial infringement   actions in the case where you participate in an   exchange, and in the case where you don\\'t. Congress   shows no concern in the notice of commercial marketing   provision with notice being too early. It says at least   180 days. And when you lift the gate, it allows the -  the -- the sponsor to go to court and litigate any   remaining patent rights they have.   Justice Breyer, the -- Congress knew how to   require something to come after one event and before   another. It does it in the very next provision,   (l)( )(B). Does not do it in the notice provision. You   shouldn\\'t read that requirement into the word   \"licensed,\" which is just a description of the       biosimilar.  62    Congress would not have extended the  -year    exclusivity period in such a bizarre way. That was a    very hotly debated item, and it would extend the    exclusivity period in every case, even when there are no    patent rights to litigate.    Our approach fully allows them to vindicate    their patent rights. We wrote them and we told them to    sue us. Now, they delayed, but they could have sued us    right away. That was the provision Congress allowed.    And in that suit they got our application, they    requested as common in -- in patent cases to request all    of our FDA correspondence. We have a -- a duty to    continue updating them.    They added -- they -- they were issued new    patent during the suit. They have added that patent to    the suit, which is also common in patent litigation.    A lot of what they are telling you blinks    reality about the way the world works, and with respect,    those kinds of policy arguments are for the Congress.    This statute works if you just apply it    according to its terms. The shall conditions are all    conditions precedent, and that\\'s made clear by the    (l)( ) provision which says, they shall sue. It would    be a very odd Federal law to say that is a violation of        Federal law, not to bring suit. It isn\\'t.  63    Congress provided consequences. If they    decide not to sue, then they can only get a reasonable    royalty. These are -- these are shalls, and they do    mean must, but the government says they don\\'t mean must    in all circumstances. They mean must if you want to    continue in this process. And if you don\\'t continue in    the process, there are benefits and burdens to both the    applicant and the sponsor at every step. And if you go    through the statute, and I recognize it\\'s a very    articulated scheme, it\\'s all one coherent whole, and it    gives them a very powerful remedy',\n",

We allow neighbors, testers, nonprofit   organizations, and cities, and developers, and real   estate brokers, all to sue to vindicate that interest.   We don't allow the -- the equivalent of a   neighbor, a co-worker, to bring an action for   discrimination that's been visited upon one of their   colleagues. We don't allow others within that kind of   realm to bring these actions. And I think that's part   of the problem that a business that makes this claim   might have.   So in the end, what I'm -- I'm suggesting is   that there are direct injuries by virtue of these two   what -- what my friend describes as buckets. A direct   injury to the City in its efforts to secure fair housing   by draining those resources, and those resources are   recoverable, and that that, indeed, satisfies any kind   of proximate cause, as well as an injury to that   interest in an integrated community that allows the   business opportunities, the social opportunities, the   professional opportunities to flow that this Court   recognized in the Gladstone case and suggested that the   appropriate -- and even my friend in his brief suggested   the appropriate damages in such an instance is the loss    43   of property value and property taxes, which, frankly,   are part and parcel of this whole mortgage loan   industry.   So we are not asking for something that's   different, that's out of the realm, that's away from   what this process is. But something that's integral to   that process.   So in the end what we suggest is the City of   Miami is not so marginally involved in Fair Housing, is   not working inconsistently, and its injuries are so fair   afield from it that we are outside the zone of interest,   whatever zone of interest applies, because, after all,   it's not a very demanding test. And there is a reason   for that, and that's because we are aggrieved in every   sense of the word by the discrimination that was   propounded here.   And at the same time, we think that that   statement from Lexmark that I quoted earlier -- that it   has to essentially flow from the fact that there was   some violation of the Act, is it sufficient too? And in   each instance, we think our -- our injury is direct, but   even if it were to be examined more minutely, as my   friend suggests, those minute steps are all true of the   individual borrower who has to take out a discriminatory   loan, who has to then default, who has to then arrive      in -- in foreclosure, who has to find that he has to  44    abandon that house, and then he can bring that lawsuit    still, because all those different steps are -- you    know, the -- the -- the financial state of the economy,    the -- the nature of his job situation, his family    situation, all have effects on that. But we recognize    that this is proximately caused -- his damages are    proximately caused from the injury that the Fair Housing    Act recognizes.    So for those reasons, I suggest that this    Court ought to affirm the Eleventh Circuit\",\n",

       "  ' Four points, Your Honor.   First, with respect to this complaint, to   paragraph 186 and so on, we agree. Our blue brief at   page 33 says that they do identify an interest, but they   have to plausibly allege some impact on segregation in   order to survive. They haven\\'t done that. They haven\\'t   told you whether segregation is increasing or decreasing   as a result of the bank\\'s conduct.   Second, the damages here they seek are way,   way broader than what they\\'re painted out to be. Just   the taxes and the complaint are bad enough. Indeed, the   Bank of America petition -- cert petition at page 34   cites one of the complaints filed by the same counsel   against Cobb County, seeking hundreds of millions of   dollars.   There are  ,300 cities in America. If you   adopt their theory, you would be allowing all of them to   bring complaints just like this.   Now, we\\'ve said that if you accept their   interpretation, you\\'d be opening the door. The   Solicitor General says, huh-uh; proximate cause is   somehow a limitation on that.   Their own proximate-cause tests, as our    56   brief explains, eliminates the directness requirement.   So I think it will be hard, and that\\'s why I don\\'t think   he had an answer, Justice Breyer, on the magazine, or   things like that.   And then, Justice Sotomayor, you asked him   how to write the opinion to avoid the gardener, and his   answer was, look at Gladstone, because Gladstone has a   direct reduction in property values. That cannot be a   consistent theory for this Court on proximate-cause   principles for many reasons, one of which Gladstone is   not a proximate-cause case at all. It\\'s not briefed or   argued.   But second, even the language he\\'s reading   to you is only at the very end of Gladstone, saying that   if you have a reduction in property value, then it will   directly reduce the tax base.   This complaint\\'s totally different. You\\'ve   got five steps, as the Solicitor General\\'s own brief   explains, before you even get to the reduction in   property value. Each of those are opportunities for   intervening causes, and all the kinds of things that   this Court in Lexmark said are the reasons why we cut   off liability at the first step.   Now, his other answer was to say, well, look   at the Congressional Report. The Congressional Report      identifies that Congress was concerned with property  57    values, and therefore concerned with cities.    That Congressional Report also says Congress    was equally concerned with employers who suffered from    segregated neighborhoods, employees who were fired    because the neighborhoods suffered from blight, and    shops and other things.    So if you take their standard, which is,    look at the Congressional Report, figure out who\\'s    harmed by housing discrimination, even downstream, you    would come to the same conclusion we do, which is this    is an unlimited theory of liability. It would allow    landlords to sue, utilities companies to sue, and,    Justice Sotomayor, gardeners to sue.    We\\'ve also said one other thing, Justice    Kagan. This gets to your point earlier about the    congressional scheme. If you adopt on zone of interest    their interpretation of \"aggrieved persons,\" 3612 allows    \"aggrieved persons\" to intervene as a matter of right in    Federal litigation.    Our view is what Congress did was it    empowered direct victims to sue, as well as some    indirect victims, in the Justice Department. Their    interpretation says, any city, including one that\\'s not    even motivated by the same type of, you know, presumably     58   wonderful motivations as the City of Miami, can come in   and intervene in a direct victims lawsuit and possibly   muck it up in any number of directions. That can\\'t   possibly be what Congress thought about when they have   used the words \"person aggrieved\" in the statute, to   allow cities to come in and interfere with -- with a -  kind of lawsuits filed by direct victims',\n",

As this Court said in   Bowman, under that doctrine, the initial authorized sale   of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that   item. And by exhausting the patentee's monopoly on that   item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any   subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as   he sees fit.   That principle goes back, of course, to the   15th century. The common law refused to enforce   restraints on alienations of chattels based on the   fundamental insight that you own the goods that you buy,   and you should be able to do with them what you wish,   and that clouds over Title -- hurt the marketability of        goods and intercommerce, and importantly, in the patent   context, allowing these downstream restrictions to be   forced would preempt secondary markets with -- which   check the patent owner's monopoly power.   Let me begin with the first question, which   is whether the authorized sale of an article embodying   the patent exhausts patent rights with respect to that   article, or whether the patentee may impose restrictions   enforceable under patent laws, such as on resale, repair   or reuse simply by stating such a restriction in the   sales agreement.

So many restrictions were not being    imposed; a few were. Of course, this is very similar to    the situation the Court confronted in Kirtsaeng where    the Court said -- there, there was a 30-year rule that    hadn't been questioned at all by decisions of this    Court. And the Court said the fact that people hadn't    acted obviously wasn't a predictor of what would happen    if the law was clarified by this Court.    And I think the -- the disruption that would    occur is amply demonstrated in the amicus briefs and    would indeed expand patent monopoly rights far beyond    anything that ever -- anyone has thought possible under    this Court's precedents.         Let me briefly talk about the -- the lower   court's decisions where it went astray. There were two   basic justifications. One was statutory. The Federal   Circuit assumed that the exhaustion doctrine was   grounded in the without-authority clause in Section   271(a) and that, therefore, Congress had given the   patentee a veto over the scope of the exhaustion rule.   We think that's not correct.   This Court's prior cases prior to 1952   didn't indicate at all that exhaustion was a question of   the patentee's authority, rather, a flat rule. And the   Court's exhaustion we think is best looked at in either   of two ways; either as a limit on the 152(a) rights, the   rights to exclude that are set forth, and what the Court   has indicated is that there are a limit on the -- the   scope of the patentee's right to exclude.   Also, the 1952 Act included in   Section 282(b)( ) a section called Defenses that set   forth defenses that could be pled. And one of those   defenses was absent of liability for infringement   thereto in obvious incorporation of the preexisting   exhaustion doctrine.   The Federal Circuit's second rationale   confused two concepts: The ability of a patentee to set   the terms for a first sale, and the ability to impose        post-sale restrictions. We think it's quite clear that   just as a patentee can decide for itself who it will   sell to, it can impose as a condition of licensing,   manufacturing and sales by others those same   restrictions. It can restrict who the licensee can sell   to just as who it can decide to sell to.   But in either case, whether the sale by the   patentee or the sale by the licensee, post-sale   restrictions are invalid as long as it's an authorized   sale. Any sale by the patentee is, of course,   authorized. In the licensee context, there's an   additional inquiry: Did the licensee abide by the terms   of the license? If it did, then the sale is authorized   and no post-sale restrictions can be enforced.   Let me turn, if I may, to the second   question, the question of international exhaustion   that -- that this case raises. We think that the   starting point here is, again, Congress's incorporation   of this Court's statements regarding the exhaustion   rule. In other words, the Patent Act should be read as   if there were provisions stating the initial authorized   sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to   that item. There's certainly nothing in the Patent Act   that limits exhaustion to sales by U.S. patentees within   the United States\",\n",

       "  \" Your Honor, I don't think this   is a question of extraterritorial application   anything -- any more than the issue in Kirtsaeng was a   question of extraterritorial application of the   Copyright Act.   The question here is whether the patentee's   acts outside the United States have an impact on its   ability to enforce its rights within the United States.   So that -- no one is saying that the sales outside the   United States are governed by the U.S. patent law,   they're obviously not, just as the sales outside the   United States under the Copyright Act are not governed   by the Copyright Act.        But the question here is whether if there is   an authorized sale outside the United States authorized   by the U.S. patentee, whether that should have the same   exhaustion consequences as a sale within the United   States. And we think the rationale of Kirtsaeng and the   broad rule that the Court has enunciated dictate that   the conclusion here should be, yes, the same exhaustion   rule should apply.   In fact, it seems to us that the   consequences that the Court pointed to in Kirtsaeng, not   only do we have an enunciation of a nongeographic rule   and the support of the common-law nongeographic rule   that the Court identified in Kirtsaeng, but the adverse   consequences that the Court pointed to are even more   dramatic here because of the fact that patented articles   are often combined into other goods through a global   supply chain.   And as a number of the briefs talk about,   just think about a situation where a phone is assembled   in China with patented chips sold from Taiwan, a screen   from China, and hundreds of other patented components   from all over. All of the sales of those components   consummated outside the United States.   The consequence there would that -- would be   that if that final phone is sold into the United States,        all of the sellers, resellers, and users of that phone   would be subject to patent infringement liability if the   U.S. rights were not expressly licensed -- U.S. rights   for sale not expressly licensed for just one patent in   that huge conglomeration of patents that were embodied   in that object.   Same for a car assembled in Canada. The car   example that the Court used in its opinion in Kirtsaeng   applies equally here. An ignition from Germany, a brake   system from the United States, everything sold and put   together outside the United States, and then the car   brought into the United States, a risk of patent   liability.   And here, the risk is even greater because   there's no fair use doctrine to moderate the application   of the rule. Patent liability, as the Court knows, is a   strict liability offense with no exceptions. And we   have the additional problem in the patent context of   patent assertion entities that the Court has referred to   that are -\",\n",

First of all, in the global supply chain    context, which is where most of these situations arise,    the fact is the sales may take place of the components    in a particular country, but they're part of a huge    supply chain that's flowing to produce finished goods    that are then going to be distributed to a large number    of companies.         Companies that sell -- that either license   their patents or sell components into that supply chain   know full well that this is a global chain and that   they -- they are not getting value that's country   specific. They are getting a value that is essentially   the average of the value in all the places where the   patent is going to be used, because that's what they   should demand because that's, in fact, the market into   which they are selling.   The end-use product is a different   situation. There certainly are products, just as the   books in -- in Kirtsaeng, that are being sold into a   particular market, and I think there are a couple of   answers to that.   One is, A, there are nonpatent constraints,   packaging, labeling, contract requirements that may   ameliorate the ability of those products to be   transshipped into the United States.   B, there are lots of different things that   go into whether or not someone gets -- how much value   one gets in the copyright context, for example.   Although the legal rules may be more even, the   enforcement of copyright vary -- principle varies   dramatically in different markets, as does the wealth in   different markets, and that affects how things can be       sold.       And lastly, as the Court pointed out, so I    think there are constraints that protect the U.S.    patentee in -- in being able to demand the value    attributable to the U.S. patent. But, lastly, as the    Court said in Kirtsaeng, price discrimination may not    necessarily be something that's guaranteed under the    patent laws --\",\n",

As -- as the briefs discuss, the -- the FDA   has full authority to prevent imports under   U.S.C.       381 of devices and to regulate reuses of devices and       drugs.

       "  \" Mr. Chief Justice, and may it   please the Court:   I'd like to address the domestic exhaustion   issue first, and I'd like to begin by responding to   Justice Kennedy's question about why hasn't the   exhaustion doctrine been codified.   The Court's historic cases in the domestic   exhaustion field have located the exhaustion principle   in the language of the predecessors of what is now 35   U.S.C. 154(a)( ). That is the provision of the Patent   Act that says the patent owner has the right to exclude   others from making, using, selling, offering for sale,   or importing the patented invention. And in addressing   predecessor versions of that language, this Court said   those exclusive rights in essence don't encompass the   right to control resale or use of a lawfully sold   article.   For example, in Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell,   the Court said -- addressed the proper interpretation of   the exclusive right to vend, and it said the right to        vend was exercised when the first authorized sale was   made. The right to vend does not encompass the right to   set resale prices.   In motion picture patents, the Court said   that its task was to determine the meaning of Congress   enacting the predecessor version of 154(a)( ).   In -- in order -- other cases, the Court has   referred to lawfully sold articles as being no longer   under the protection of the act of Congress, or that the   exhaustion rule delimits the scope of the patent grant.   So it's true that the Patent Act doesn't contain an   analogue to   U.S.C. 109(a), which is the Copyright Act   provision that specifically addresses the scope of   exhaustion, but the exhaustion doctrine has historically   been understood by this Court as a gloss on the   exclusive rights conferred by 154(a)( ) and its   predecessors, and unless Congress wanted to change the   exhaustion rule, either to get -- get rid of it entirely   or to substitute some different triggering event, there   was no need for it to amend -- to -- to codify an   explicit exhaustion provision by continuing in effect   and by tweaking the exclusive rights conferred by the   grant of a patent, Congress should be understood to have   manifested its intention that historic conceptions of   domestic -- domestic exhaustion would continue to have       sway.       Now, the second point I make about domestic    exhaustion is that the court of appeals' err, in our    view, stem to a large extent from its misreading of    general talking pictures. General talking pictures    dealt not with a -- not with simply a restriction on the    use that purchasers could make after an article had been    lawfully sold. It dealt with the conditions on which    its patentee's licensee could sell the article in the    first place. And the -- the exhaustion doctrine is    also -- often referred to colloquially as the first-sale    doctrine, and I think that's a reason -- there's a    reason for that. It's that the presence or absence of    exhaustion turns on whether there has been a lawful    first sale, and if the licensee departs from the    instruction of the patentee and sells the article in a    way that is not authorized, there's no lawful first    sale, and therefore, no patent exhaustion. But once the    article has been lawfully sold, any restrictions on    resale or use that the patentee purports to impose    downstream can be enforceable only under contract law or    commercial law, not under patent law.    And that brings me to my third point about    domestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on    the other side is -- on the Respondent's side is that         application of domestic exhaustion principles here would   prevent parties from reaching agreements that might be   economically advantageous to both of them.   And so the Respondent says, well, if I have   had particular buyer who only wants to use the cartridge   once and doesn't want to pay extra for the privilege of   reusing it, if he never intends to do that, why   shouldn't we be able to negotiate a deal under which I   charge him less in return for his commitment to only use   it once? And the answer is nothing in the exhaustion   doctrine prevents parties from reaching those agreements   and enforcing them as a matter of contract law, if they   are enforceable under the -- the law of the relevant   jurisdiction.   The policy judgment that this Court has   historically attributed to Congress is not a judgment   that these sorts of restrictions are bad or should be   unenforceable. It's simply a judgment that possession   of a patent doesn't give the patentee any greater rights   to make or enforce restrictions like this than a seller   of similar unpatented property would have under the   rules of -- of general contract law.   And so, in several of the exhaustion   decisions, the Court has distinguished between the   limits on patent remedies and the alternative remedies        that might be available under what the Court has often   referred to as the general law, the body of contract and   commercial law that applies to -- to all sellers.   I'd like to turn now, if I may, to the   question of international exhaustion. And the position   of the United States on -- on this issue is between that   of the two parties, it's our view that a patent -- a   U.S. patent owner who sells goods -- patented goods   abroad should be able to reserve its U.S. rights but   need -- needs to do so expressly.
