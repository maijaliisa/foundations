    "\n",
    "If you choose this project, the main challenge will be to come up with a database schema that organizes information by film as well as by critic. \n",

    "From a geocoding standpoint we would visualize this data set based on the country of the critics, and we could, with extra research, View the data set buy the country of the filmmaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an exploratory standpoint, here are some questions we could ask: \n",

    "1. Which countries have the most directors?\n",

    "3. What year had the most movies be selected?\n",
    "4. What are some other questions you can think of?\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall challenge, once the initial page is properly formatted into a database, is to find a way to enhance this data set with another source, and integrate that information with the information from the BBC poll."

    "https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx\n",

    "Below, I show the code that I used to download all the PDFs of the the oral arguments before the Supreme Court from 2016, which I then convert to text files: that is where the fun starts. The goal of this project Will be to use regular expressions to parse the text to do oral arguments, that we can then search and measure the word spoken by the Supreme Court justices from case to case and across cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is open: we want to have well structured data with the words of the justices entered. We also want to have a useful data set for each case that includes further information such as the final decision, the votes of each justice, who wrote the decision (and perhaps the dissenting opinion too). It is up to you what should ultimately be included and how we will be able to search through the data and view results.\n",
